14:11 < khuxkm> ben: can you put channel op on my NickServ account now? (since that problem's fixed)
14:11 -!- mode/#meta [+o khuxkm] by ChanServ
14:12 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm, What is NickServ?
14:12 <@khuxkm> nickname registration service
14:12 <@khuxkm> so nobody can pretend to be me
14:12 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh
14:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> What happens if multiple users try to log in with the same name btw?
14:13 < doug> ben: i've a shell account, i don't think i've got a tilde.team account (yet)
14:13 <@khuxkm> it won't let them
14:13 <@ben> were you the one trying to use the signup form and it wasn't working?
14:13 <@khuxkm> even w/o a NickServ
14:13 <@ben> could you try it now?
14:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Ohh
14:14 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Can you change nickname in the middle of using the chat btw?
14:14 < doug> yup, work now
14:14 <@ben> yeah
14:14 < doug> works, even
14:15 < doug> dunno if you've thought about adding *.tilde.team to the server cert
14:15 -!- minerbot2 [minerbot2@127.0.0.1] has joined #meta
14:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Can’t you just ignore the ssl warning?
14:15 -!- jan is now known as nicknamechange
14:15 <@ben> ok doug i added your shell account and ssh key
14:15 -!- nicknamechange is now known as jan
14:15 < doug> cool
14:18 < doug> are all the tilde servers linux?
14:18 <@ben> afaik yeah :)
14:19 < doug> seems i can't change my shell w/o knowing my password
14:19 <@ben> default pw is tilde
14:19 < doug> cool
14:19 <@ben> i'm sending you the welcome mail now
14:19 <@ben> feel free to change it
14:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> By the way what is mail?
14:20 <@ben> what?
14:20 <@ben> https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=email
14:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I have You got mail when I log in to shell
14:20 <@ben> check your mail then
14:20 <@ben> mutt or alpine are command line mail clients
14:20 <@ben> or you can connect smtp/imap
14:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh
14:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Wait so I have an email?
14:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> On tilde?
14:21 <@ben> yeah it should be freeappsw@tilde.team
14:21 <@ben> or you can use @tilde.zone @tilde.chat or @tildeteam.org
14:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I thought I could only make this address forward to my other email
14:21 <@ben> not anymore
14:21 <@ben> you can still do that though
14:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
14:21 <@ben> we added mail 2 weeks ago or so
14:21 <@ben> it's relatively nwe
14:21 <@ben> s/we/ew
14:21 < sedbot> <ben> it's relatively new
14:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I still don’t get the idea of this tilde type of community really
14:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Like it’s cool
14:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> But why?
14:22 <@ben> why not
14:22 <@ben> https://tilde.team/wiki/?page=code-of-conduct
14:22 <@ben> see: goals
14:23 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
14:23 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Most of the chapters of this article look like some generic chat community rules
14:24 < doug> i figure the tilde stuff is a bunch of people who wanna learn some shell magic
14:24 < doug> well, was at the beginning
14:25 <@ben> https://paste.tilde.team/zGt6
14:25 <@ben> that's what i was trying to show from that
14:26 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh okay
14:26 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> This community is nice anyway
14:26 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Was just wondering
14:26 <@ben> tl;dr learn by doing and helping. be excellent to each other. have fun!
14:26 <@ben> tilde.team exists to foster an engaged community for socializing, learning, and making cool stuff
14:27 <@ben> yeah that's the central goal
14:27 <@ben> centered around a public access shell server
14:27 < doug> what if i want to make stultifyingly dull stuff?
14:27 <@ben> you do you my dude
14:27 <@ben> :P
14:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
14:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Okay still I can’t seem to be able to live without discord features in chat
14:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I guess I am just way too used to them
14:36 <@ben> which features?
14:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Like edit message, delete message, typing statuses
14:36 <@ben> ah
14:36 <@ben> yeah that doesn't have an equivalent on the irc side
14:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Irc doesn’t have any statuses am I right?
14:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Like online, idle and that stuff?
14:37 <@khuxkm> yeah
14:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> 😦
14:38 <@khuxkm> it was built for slow connections
14:38 <@ben> correct
14:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Yes I do understand
14:38 <@khuxkm> where all that stuff would've taken too much bandwidth
14:38 <@khuxkm> and I like it
14:38 <@ben> it does have away and back
14:38 <@khuxkm> away is kinda like idle
14:38 <@ben> yeah
14:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> But I just don’t personally see the charm in using irc
14:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It is purely my opinion tho
14:38 <@ben> my client auto sets away if i don't have any windows open
14:39 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> How does away look like?
14:40 <@ben> it's just a status message that shows up in the log
14:40 <@ben> status messages (joins/parts/quits/aways) don't get sent across the discord bridge
14:41 <@ben> we don't have a user list that syncs between the two anyways
14:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I mean it’s not possible to put new users to discord guild
14:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Without them actually joining it
14:42 <@ben> ah i suppose so
14:47 < jan> irc doesn't have statuses, but clients can have those features
14:47 -!- jan is now known as jan6_
14:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Ye
14:48 <@ben> jan6_ did you register your nick with nickserv
14:48 < jan6_> nah
14:48 < jan6_> no need yet
14:48 <@ben> that's fair
14:49 <@ben> i registered mine in case tilde.town/~ben gets greedy
14:49 <@ben> and wants to use his name
14:50 < jan6_> nobody else is jan6 anywhere afaik, and people don't seem to impersonate me in the rare cases I'm disguise-nicked, so whatever
14:50 <@ben> good deal
14:59 <@ben> http://bash.org/?962705
15:08 < doug> edit message is nice.  not so sure about typing statuses.
15:10 <@ben> i don't really care about typing statuses
15:11 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> doug actually it is a little annoying when I edit the message here (kinda automatic really already) but then I realize that it didn’t actually update for you and I have to write a separate message
15:11 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Same applies for deleting
15:12 <@ben> i thought the bot would send something like edit: new message here
15:12 <@ben> guess not
15:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Lemme try
15:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Did it update?
15:14 <@ben> nope
15:40 <@ben> micaiah
15:40 <@ben> @~miciaha
15:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
15:40 <@ben> @~micaiah
15:40 <@ben> paging dr flask
15:58 < l4p1n> guess what: Blender uses PeerTube
15:58 <@ben> Did they mirror their content there?
15:59 < l4p1n> there were forced by youtube because yt blocked blender's content worldwide
16:00 <@ben> Fkin yt
16:00 <@ben> They've been getting worse and worse
16:00 < l4p1n> that's why we PeerTube
16:00 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> PeerTube?
16:00 <@ben> Should ~team host one?
16:00 <@ben> We're gonna start running out of hard drive space at some point
16:00 <@ben> Lol
16:01 < l4p1n> i totally should send you that video
16:01 <@ben> which?
16:01 < l4p1n> https://framatube.org/videos/watch/217eefeb-883d-45be-b7fc-a788ad8507d3 explaining all the things about PeerTube
16:02 < l4p1n> have you ever heard about Framasoft ? it's a french association
16:04 <@ben> Yeah I've heard of it :)
16:05 < l4p1n> you know all the cool things they do then :) ^^
16:08 <@ben> they have tons of things!
16:08 <@ben> framagit framadate frama*
16:09 <@ben> all the things
16:10 < l4p1n> all the things you can selfhost. And yeah, just checked out df -h, definitely going to run out of space at some point ^^'
16:11 <@ben> how much do we have now
16:11 <@ben> 17 used so far
16:12 < l4p1n> 93 GB total, 17 used 
16:12 <@ben> not tooo bad
16:13 < l4p1n> my nas: 824 GB used, 1.9 TB left. why not storing all the things on a nas who asked for nothing
16:13 <@ben> that's a possibility
16:13 <@ben> it'd had to be a network mount
16:13 <@ben> cause the tilde machine is in a datacenter
16:14 < l4p1n> ik
16:14 < doug> it's an actual machine?
16:14 <@ben> it's a vps 
16:14 <@ben> in a datacenter :P
16:14 <@ben> somewhere in california i think
16:15 < doug> ah ok
16:15 < jan6_> wow, framasoft has a lot of stuff
16:15 <@ben> tooooons of stoff
16:15 <@ben> s/of/uf
16:15 < sedbot> <ben> tooooons uf stoff
16:15 < jan6_> I had no idea framinetest was a thing, though minetest IS definitely cool
16:15 < l4p1n> you have frama-all the things
16:16 < doug> that's quadranet?
16:16 < jan6_> what-a-net?
16:16 < l4p1n> Quadrature du Net ?
16:16 < l4p1n> ya mean ?
16:16 <@ben> quadraneti guess
16:17 < doug> not your box?
16:17 < jan6_> I only know barely enough french to understand based on context, so what is it?
16:17 <@ben> quadranet is something from the host
16:17 < l4p1n> La Quadrature du Net is yet another french association which defends peps' right and freedom on the internet
16:18 <@ben> framasoft is a french organization 
16:18 < jan6_> too complex of a name
16:19 < l4p1n> list of all the free services framasoft offers, in case you want it: https://lutim.l4p1n.ch/WgBsolRd/LYxtGix3.png
16:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Free store?
16:20 < jan6_> you can sell your freedom there ;P
16:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> For free?
16:21 < l4p1n> it's more or less a list of services you can selfhost if you want :p \n i guess myframa is more a shaarli ^^
16:22 <@ben> or you can use the ones they're already hosting
16:26 -!- freeappsw [uid304887@charlton.irccloud.com] has joined #meta
16:26 < l4p1n> if u want to give framasky -- framasoft's sysadmin -- a little moar work :p
16:26 <@ben> lol 
16:26 <@ben> that's an option :P
16:29 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
16:29 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> What channels exist on the new connected irc?
16:29 <@ben> you can do /list
16:29 < freeappsw> In where?
16:30 <@ben> https://paste.tilde.team/tTW5
16:30 <@ben> anywhere
16:30 <@ben> /list
16:30 < l4p1n> everywhere
16:31 < freeappsw> Okay that worked
16:31 < freeappsw> So the / commands are handled by the client same as discord?
16:32 <@ben> some are handled clientside
16:32 <@ben> and some are serverside
16:32 < freeappsw> Also nickserv tells me to register nickname...
16:33 <@ben> you don't have to if you don't want to
16:33 < freeappsw> Will I have to change anything in my client if I do?
16:33 <@ben> no
16:33 < freeappsw> Okay I should try
16:34 <@ben> do /msg nickserv help
16:34 < freeappsw> Can I send the command here or on that landing channel thing?
16:35 < jan6_> nickserv just makes it so that if you don't identify with your password, your nick is force-changed
16:35 < freeappsw> Okay turns out I could use the Send Direct Message thing in my client
16:35 < jan6_> yep
16:40  * jan6_ just remembered https://anonops.com/ exists, and that they have a radio to listen to
16:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Btw
16:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> How do you do formatting in irc?
16:44 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Here comes the Silence
16:44 <@ben> depends on the client
16:44 < jan6_> what formatting? there IS NO FORMATTING in the protocol
16:44 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Ohh
16:44 <@ben> lol as i said
16:44 <@ben> it's all clientside
16:44 < jan6_> but that IS italic/cursive text
16:44 <@ben> are you sure about that?
16:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> In discord you use markdown
16:45 < jan6_> a lot of clients support the mirc formats, I think
16:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Well a very limited version of markdown
16:45 < jan6_> I am sure about that
16:45 < jan6_> I know
16:45 < jan6_> `code stuffs`
16:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
16:46 < jan6_> *A***b**_c_
16:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
16:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> For me it’s kinda broken so the bot doesn’t get that
16:47 < jan6_> well, I think bold and italic still come through for me, on weechat, though yeah, it's client-specific
16:47 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Sad
16:47 <@ben> is this bold and this italic?
16:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It would be a nice feature to have formatting
16:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> But there isn’t a unite format
16:48 <@ben> https://ircv3.net/
16:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And yes I see it properly this time
16:48 <@ben> nice
16:52 <@khuxkm> https://quotes.tilde.team/quote/1 the QDB's coming along nicely (I say as you can't vote/submit at all)
16:53 <@khuxkm> is there any way to give the QDB a favicon?
16:54 <@ben> do you want to just use the tilde.team one? o
16:54 <@ben> or a different one
16:54 < l4p1n> by putting favicon.ico or something like that (png should work too if you specify it in <head>) ?
16:54 <@ben>     <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="96x96" href="https://tilde.team/favicon-96x96.png">
16:55 <@ben> throw that in <head>
16:56 < jan6_> might not work for IE, but who uses that nowdays, eh?
16:57  * jan6_ out (Reason: 13:57:18)
16:57 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oooh 13:57 is your time

17:30 <@khuxkm> just have to implement voting and listing pages
17:30 <@ben> whoa nice
17:31 <@ben> if you add class="form-control" to the inputs on /quote/submit they will look nicer :)
17:31 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> What is this quotes thing about?
17:31 <@ben> in the style of http://bash.org

17:34 <@ben> lol you're fine
17:34 <@ben> a lot of it is easily googleable
17:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh okay anyway I gtg, bye
17:35 <@khuxkm> is there any way to poke an address without actually going there?
17:35 <@ben> how do you mean?
17:35 <@khuxkm> (for my upvote/downvote)
17:36 <@khuxkm> nvm
17:36 <@khuxkm> figured it out
17:36 <@ben> http://bash.org/?454203
17:36 <@ben> wouldn't that just be the difference between post and get requests?
17:37 <@ben> post to actually updoot
17:37 <@ben> and get to see the conuts
17:37 <@ben> s/nu/us
17:37 < sedbot> <ben> and get to see the cousts
17:37 <@ben> omf
17:39 <@khuxkm> :P
17:39 <@ben> i'll start on the auth module
17:39 <@ben> can you push to gitea
17:40 <@khuxkm> why do we need the auth module?
17:40 <@ben> idk
17:40 <@ben> why not
17:40 <@ben> we already have it
17:40 <@ben> maybe only auth for submitting?
17:40 <@ben> no auth for viewing
17:41 < khuxkm|lounge> what's actually going on https://quotes.tilde.team/quote/2
17:41 < khuxkm|lounge> it was broke and now it's not
17:41 < khuxkm|lounge> oh well
17:42 <@ben> oh
17:42 < khuxkm|lounge> I mean, yeah, you can spam upvotes
17:42 <@ben> so what
17:42 <@ben> lol
17:42 <@ben> if you rly want to spam upboats go ahead
17:43 < khuxkm|lounge> :P
17:43 <@ben> seems fair to me
17:45 <@ben> so khuxkm|lounge you're thinking no auth at all?
17:46 <@khuxkm> not really necessary
17:46 <@khuxkm> if it gets spammed to hell then we can add it
17:46 <@ben> ok that sounds good
17:46 <@ben> i'm not anticipating it getting spammed to hell
17:46 <@ben> but it's possible i guess
17:47 <@ben> should we integrate it with any of the bots
17:47 <@khuxkm> oooh
17:47 <@khuxkm> api design time
17:47 <@khuxkm> :P
17:47 <@ben> lmao
17:48 <@ben> i mean 
17:48 <@khuxkm> /api/quotes for a full list
17:48 <@ben> you just need to call the submit endpoint
17:48 <@khuxkm> to put a quote there, sure
17:48 <@ben> i guess it is just a sqlite db
17:48 <@khuxkm> but what about getting quotes out?
17:48 <@ben> and search ?
17:48 <@ben> hmmm
17:48 <@ben> idk
17:48 <@ben> more design decisions than i anticipated
17:51 <@ben> search can just be full-text search
17:51 <@ben> i don't anticipate it being anything more than that
17:52 <@khuxkm> idk about search
17:52 <@khuxkm> but we have randomness and voting
17:52 <@khuxkm> I'd say that's pretty good for a webapp cooked up in an afternoon
17:53 <@khuxkm> brb, dinner
17:53 <@ben> lol yeah that's pretty dope

19:01 < brendantcc> hey there all
19:03 <@ben> what up brendantcc
19:03 < brendantcc> not much... what have i missed? the server seems to have restarted - again.
19:04 <@ben> i don't remember it restarting since last night
19:04 <@ben> i've been able to just /rehash the settings now
19:04 <@ben> without restarting it
19:06 < brendantcc> huh... okay... NickServ was asking me to identify myself at 23:22 last night (AEST).
19:06 < brendantcc> of course, i wasn't onliee at that time.
19:07 < brendantcc> *online
19:07 <@ben> yeah nickserv might kick you if you don't identify
19:08 < brendantcc> does it just ask for a password every few hours...?
19:08 <@ben> no it shouldn't
19:08 <@ben> just when you connect
19:09 < brendantcc> TheLounge should've had me connected overnight, so i'm now confused
19:10 <@ben> yeah it should've stayed connected
19:10 <@ben> i'm not sure what happened then
19:11 < brendantcc> yeah i just had a look at the main log thing... looks like a system reboot occurred either on the irc server, or the TheLounge instance's server.
19:14 < brendantcc> the irc ran the MOTD command at 23:22 last night. i can go only as far back as the start of that command.
19:15 < brendantcc> well, as far back as connecting to the irc at that time.
19:17 < l4p1n> hi brendantcc 
19:23 <@ben> ah 
19:23 <@ben> i updated irc.bhh.sh
19:23 <@ben> that's what happened
19:23 < brendantcc> ahh okay
19:24 < brendantcc> so what's new?
19:26 <@ben> not much
19:27 <@ben> watching blade runner 2049
19:27 < brendantcc> huh... okay... while i'm watching a shooting stars meme compilation cause why not
19:28 <@ben> lol old meme
19:28 <@ben> not dead yet?
19:30 < brendantcc> well it only came back to me because Spotify suggested the original song was the luckiest one to listen to for the Aussies to win in the World Cup
19:30 <@ben> huh
19:30 < brendantcc> of course, i'm not really a socc- a football person
19:30 <@ben> that's an interesting suggestion, spotify
19:31 <@ben> i'm not a sport person either
19:31 < brendantcc> however i do watch the other footy - the AFL, whenever the team i go for is playing
19:32 <@ben> hand egg?
19:32 <@ben> rugby, american football, or soccer?
19:32 < brendantcc> yeah... for more info - https://www.google.com.au/search?safe=strict&q=AFL&stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLQz9U3yDNMqVDiBLGSszMMLLX4nPNzc_PzgjNTUssTK4sBtOlARScAAAA&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9rOGX8eDbAhUEe7wKHXvuC1YQxA0ImgIwJw&biw=1366&bih=624
19:33 < brendantcc> good ol' Aussie footy
19:33 < l4p1n> tonight i learned that brendantcc is probably an Australian ^^'
19:34 <@ben> not just probably
19:34 <@ben> that looks like rugby
19:34 < brendantcc> Ohh it's footy, alright.
19:34 <@ben> oh
19:34 < l4p1n> my nas' disks can finally rest
19:34 < brendantcc> i'll look up a game highlights for ya\
19:35 < l4p1n> they're not dead yet, they're just sleeping tightly before having to wake up at 3:15 because someone else is using my nas as a backup too
19:36 < l4p1n> backup server too*
19:36 < brendantcc> ironically enough, a game that my team was in was the top hit
19:36 < brendantcc> here you go, ben - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sryt7sLQXd0
19:36 <@ben> l4p1n why are you letting someone else use your nas
19:37 <@ben> rugby for sure
19:38 < l4p1n> becuase it's someone i know and he's using it for his backups too in case his server goes wild
19:38 < brendantcc> i just found a video that may help in the suggestions lol... sounds a bit cheesy in the background - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMZYZcoAcU0
19:38 <@ben> fair enough :P
19:38 < brendantcc> the video even says "no, it's not rugby"
19:40 <@ben> ahhh i see
19:40 < brendantcc> well, gotta go. i'll be back soon enough
19:40 < l4p1n> ++
19:40 < l4p1n> btw, australia is UTC-how much ?
19:41 < l4p1n> nah, UTC+how much i should say ?

20:17 <@ben> what there is only one utc
20:18 < brendantcc> different utc offsets.
20:18 < brendantcc> my bad i worded it wrong :/
20:18 < brendantcc> (from wikipedia - the top hit on google) - Australia uses three main time zones: Australian Western Standard Time (AWST; UTC+08:00), Australian Central Standard Time (ACST; UTC+09:30), and Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST; UTC+10:00).
20:19 < brendantcc> Australian Eastern Standard Time is the timezone i'm in

20:21 < brendantcc> soo it's 3:21am there?

21:39 <@cmccabe> not a lot. i've been offline a lot the past couple days.
21:40 <@ben> good call :P
21:40 <@ben> i was on more than i should have been this weekend
21:40 <@ben> but yeah

21:42 <@ben> yeah no
21:42 <@ben> oh well
21:43 <@cmccabe> i was thinking of setting up an irc log analyzer.  do you have any that you particularly like?
21:44 <@ben> hmm
21:44 <@ben> no i don't
21:44 <@ben> whichever one you like!
21:44 <@ben> we could have logs
21:44 <@cmccabe> mircstats, pisg, ircstats are afew.  i might try mircstats.
21:44 <@ben> oki
21:44 <@ben> does it run as a bot user?
21:45 <@cmccabe> not sure yet. part of it is just a report (maybe html) of interesting stats. e.g. a stat on another site once said that cmccabe is stupid because he asks so many questions.
21:45 <@cmccabe> who? me? ask questions?

06:10 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And hi
06:13 <@khuxkm> ...and done
06:13 <@khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW it's a bot I made
06:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh
06:13 <@cmccabe> what does it do?
06:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> An irc bot?
06:13 <@khuxkm> the original minerbot is a mess of spaghetti code on ~town
06:13 <@khuxkm> ye
06:14 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I guess generic multi purpose bot?
06:14 <@cmccabe> any specific functions yet?
06:14 <@khuxkm> so far, not really
06:15 <@khuxkm> besides github/gitea integration
06:15 <@khuxkm> I plan on slowly adding minerbot's features
06:15 <@cmccabe> i'll set up a bots page on the wiki -- unpublished for now. it would be neat to eventually have a list of ~team irc bots and their functions.
06:16 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Isn’t there only one bot on here being the discord bridge?
06:16 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And that bot that edits messages
06:18 <@cmccabe> one bot now.
06:19 <@cmccabe> but especially if we can get people creating cool (and non-resource draining) bots, that would be cool.
06:19 <@khuxkm> for example the hiatus !steven-universe command, which I just set up the library for
06:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Unfortunately I don’t know how to make irc bots
06:19 <@khuxkm> "Historical Friction: Stevonnie crash-lands in the middle of watermelons shaped like himself."
06:20 <@cmccabe> freappsw - it's not too hard. you just need a program that connects to an irc server and channel, listens to input from users, and then responds based on certain key words
06:21 <@cmccabe> there is a lot of example bot code on the interwebs, and even pre-existing bot frameworks that you can customize
06:22 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I know how bots operate, I make discord bots, I just don’t know how irc works

06:25 <@khuxkm> jan can attest

06:33 <@khuxkm> !su
06:33 <@khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW yep
06:33  * jan6|home attempted a modular C-based bot, but never learned how to properly execute external programs
06:33 <@khuxkm> IRC is extremely basic
06:33 < jan6|home> ^
06:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> So basically any bot can connect to any server and you can’t restrict is doing so
06:35 < jan6|home> sure
06:35 < jan6|home> you can ask "are you a real human" or "do you drink H2O" and stuff, to see if it's a human though
06:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oh
06:36 < jan6|home> "are you a bot" and stuff can easily be cheated, but there are many questions, "what did you eat yesterday" for example
06:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Discord doesn’t really suffer from that cause 1)Legit bots are oauth apps that can only be added by user with MANAGE_GUILD 2)Userbots are not allowed by the API ToS
06:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> But I still have bot protection in my bot
06:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Like it blocks access to all channels until you complete a recaptcha
06:38 < jan6|home> not a bad idea
06:39 < jan6|home> and on IRC you can have invite-only channels, or set a channelmode so only some users can talk
06:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Discord has roles so you can set up a role that doesn’t have access to channels and assign this role on join and then after the verification is successful just remove the role
06:40 < jan6|home> I guess you could make an IRC bot to have similar functionality
06:43 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Okay the second part of my protection system can’t be applied for irc and it basically measures how suspicious the account is based on the account age, difference between account creation and joining guild, and having a profile picture

07:01 <@khuxkm> forgot an underscore
07:02 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> where?
07:02 <@khuxkm> in the code
07:02 <@khuxkm> now it's complaining about not having a thread library?
07:02 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> hmmm
07:02 <@khuxkm> thought that was in stdlib
07:02 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> is it c?
07:03 <@khuxkm> Python
07:03 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> hmmm
07:04 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I never really worked with py...
07:04 <@khuxkm> python's urllib3 is broke
07:04 <@khuxkm> so it's trying to import thread, right?
07:04 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> urllib3?
07:04 <@khuxkm> the library's called "threading"
07:05 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> hmmm
07:05 <@khuxkm> there is a library called thread, but it's been renamed to _thread since
07:05 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> https://docs.python.org/2/library/thread.html
07:06 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> Note The thread module has been renamed to _thread in Python 3. The 2to3 tool will automatically adapt imports when converting your sources to Python 3; however, you should consider using the high-level threading module instead.
07:06 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> why switch to here to send links tho?
07:06 <@khuxkm> 'cause it's the same window
07:06 <@khuxkm> :P
07:06 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> also I gave you the tilde role on here
07:06 <@khuxkm> and the discord tab is closer than the lounge tab
07:06 <@khuxkm> cool thanks
07:06 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> as I guess ben is not really ever going to go to discord and set up stuff
07:07 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> also I guess I should change the irc server hostname in channel topic to new one
07:08 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> also why dont you use the desktop app of discord? the web app is just meh...
07:10 <@khuxkm> chromebook
07:10 <@khuxkm> devmoded chromebook, but chromebook nonetheless
07:10 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ohhh
07:11 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> you can run android apps in devmode afaik
07:13 <@khuxkm> yeah
07:13 <@khuxkm> but web app > android app IMO
07:14 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ye
07:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It comes like Desktop App > Web App > iOS App ≈ Android App

07:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> is it some special bot framework?
07:35 <@khuxkm> nope
07:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> oh
07:35 <@khuxkm> just built on top of jaraco's IRC bot library
07:35 <@khuxkm> check it out

07:35 < minerbot2> khuxkm: khuxkm/minerbot2 - minerbot reborn; https://git.tilde.team/khuxkm/minerbot2
07:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> discord bot frameworks usually come with such features
07:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> but I am not using one of them
07:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I just literally wrote the bot using events and if clauses
07:36 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> https://git.tilde.team/khuxkm/minerbot2/src/branch/master/bot.py#L124
07:36 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW good on you, learning closer to the meta
07:36 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> wow... s/meta/metal (for IRC clarity)
07:37 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> but that's the exact line where command processing takes place
07:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> okay I use locales so you wont really see actual messages in the code but this is how about command looks like if (commandIs(message, "about")){         var channelEmbed = new discordapp.RichEmbed().setTitle(i18n[thisGuildLocale].about.EmbedTitle).setDescription(i18n[thisGuildLocale].about.EmbedDesc).addField(i18n[thisGuildLocale].about.VersionCatTitle, botVersion).addField(i18n[thisGuildLocale].about.InviteLinkCatTitle,
07:38 < tildebridge> inviteLink).addField(i18n[thisGuildLocale].about.WebsiteCatTitle, "https://oxybot.freeappsw.space/").setColor(0x03A9F4);         message.channel.send("", {embed: channelEmbed});     }     if
07:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> (sorry about the formatting probs copied not the best way)
07:39 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> and command is basically is js function commandIs(message, command){     if (blackList.includes(message.author.id)){         return false;     }     if (message.channel.type == "dm") return false;     else return message.content.toLowerCase().startsWith(prefix + command); }
07:39 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> I mean, if it makes you feel better, discord-irc parses out code blocks
07:39 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> so no matter how nicely you format it, it'll still look like shit in IRC
07:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> sorry
07:40 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> it's fine
07:40 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> discord-irc is stupid and needs to be replaced
07:40 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> 😛
07:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I have an idea of making it support that bot you use to edit messages
07:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> So it catches the command and edits it
07:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> and doesnt show that you run it
07:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> nor the output of edit bot
07:42 <@khuxkm> currently just working on tvdb api stuffs
07:42 <@khuxkm> for eventual inclusion in minerbot
07:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> tvdb?
07:42 <@khuxkm> the website I use for tv show data
07:43 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> do you have wiki support?
07:43 <@khuxkm> for what?
07:43 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> http://000-default.co.nf/mbp-5b2a3dec70e26 like this
07:43 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> for the bot
07:45 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> no
07:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> oh
07:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> that sometimes is handy
07:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> also image search
07:46 <@khuxkm> the first wiki support I want is being able to find wikis
07:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> oh
07:46 <@khuxkm> if I can't find a wiki I can't do anything about it
07:46 <@khuxkm> (referring to git project wikis)
07:47 <@khuxkm> I want to be able to do "!github wiki nesbox/TIC-80 btn" and have it work
07:47 <@khuxkm> (it would work for GitHub already, as those links are fairly standard, but IDK about Gitea)
07:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> mine is originally made for all mediawiki websites but wikipedia seems the only website where the API works properly

09:27 <@khuxkm> this is more than even the original does
09:28 <~ben> frick yeah
09:28 <~ben> and probably better organized at this point right?
09:28 <@khuxkm> ye
09:30 <@khuxkm> got irssi to split showing this window and window #3 (#team)
09:30 <~ben> solid
09:30 <~ben> https://git.tilde.team/meta/tilde.chat
09:30 <@khuxkm> gonna quick reorganize
09:30 <~ben> committed and pushed
09:30 <@khuxkm> there we go
09:30 <@khuxkm> now meta's on top
09:30 <~ben> oh god it's worse than i rember: https://git.tilde.team/meta/tilde.chat/src/branch/master/index.php
09:31 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ok im back
09:31 <@khuxkm> and to pull down, I just go to /var/www/html/tilde.chat/public_html and git pull?
09:31 <@khuxkm> I have perms for that, right?
09:31 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> so amirite that the new irc server is team.tilde.chat ?
09:31 <~ben> just /var/www/html/tilde.chat
09:31 <~ben> @~FreeAppSW yes. just tilde.chat should work fine as well
09:32 <~ben> khuxkm yes
09:32 <@khuxkm> ben: also, this is better, since now I have the ability to tell if you're ignoring me v. if you're chatting away in #team
09:32 <@khuxkm> :P
09:32 <~ben> i'm not sure why we have two now
09:32 <~ben> lmao
09:32 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> so #meta is like global and #team is like internal channel?
09:33 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> yeah
09:34 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> you can't access #team or #town from yourtilde, can't access #team or #your from tilde.town, and can't access #town or #your from tilde.team
09:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ohh, like that
09:34 <~ben> i'm not sure if #meta or #tilde is going to be the main channel
09:34 <~ben> probably #meta
09:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> how do you know where am I connecting from tho
09:35 <~ben> it's a setting on the ircd
09:35 <~ben> when you join, the server tells you which one you're connected to
09:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> so I do have to put team. in the hostname?
09:36 <~ben> that should be the default
09:36 <~ben> so either way
09:36 <@khuxkm> esp. since we're the only ~ with open IRC that's participating
09:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> open irc?
09:37 <@khuxkm> so brennen will eventually bring ~city to us?
09:37 <~ben> i think so 
09:37 <@khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW as in, IRC that is world-connectable
09:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> oh so listen * not localhost?
09:37 <~ben> he said he was planning on adding an ircd after a debian upgrade
09:38 <~ben> deepend is your.tilde.chat accessible outside of the yourtilde box?
09:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> btw
09:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> is it possible to make an irc bot that will be able to work on multiple servers?
09:41 <@khuxkm> yep
09:42 <@khuxkm> but you can't use the library I use (it only siupports single server)
09:42 <@khuxkm> s/siupp/supp/
09:42 < sedbot> <khuxkm> but you can't use the library I use (it only supports single server)
09:42 <@khuxkm> PircBot (and derivative PircBotX), both in Java, support multiple connections
09:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I guess I will have to start like a new instance of the bot for each server

09:44 < tildebridge> <~benbot> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387272314863091713/458990409658531840/help.png
09:44 <~ben> lol benbot ftw
09:44 <~ben> still up
09:44 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> my php bot just completely died
09:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> like works for 3 minutes then freezes in "Reconnecting"
09:45 <~ben> hmmm
09:45 <~ben> i guess it's still running
09:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> yes
09:45 <@khuxkm> how does one do an include in PHP?
09:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> doesnt the irc relay mirror bots?
09:45 <~ben> include 'path/to/file';
09:45 <@khuxkm> trying to do header/footer stuff
09:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> include("filename");
09:46 <~ben> parentheses are optional for include and require iirc
09:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> yes
09:46 <@khuxkm> so if header.php has "<div>" and footer.php has "</div>" (as an example)
09:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I am too used to them cause js
09:46 <~ben> yup!
09:46 <~ben> include 'header.php';
09:47 <~ben> include 'footer.php';
09:47 <@khuxkm> thanks
09:47 <~ben> and stuff in between
09:47 <~ben> if you close the ?> php thing you're in html now
09:49 <@khuxkm> aigth
09:49 <@khuxkm> thanks
09:49 <@khuxkm> s/aigth/aight/
09:49 <@khuxkm> :P
09:49 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> actually I noticed that I now use require() with parentheses in php more
09:49 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> cause well I just got too used to writing js
09:51 <~ben> :)
09:51 <~ben> what are you wanting to put on the tilde.chat site khuxkm?
09:51 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> idk
09:52 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> just wanted to experiment a little and possibly make more of a page
09:52 <~ben> lol sure thing
09:52 < tildebridge> <khuxkm> no offense, but right now it seems like someone plonked a landing page on the domain 😛
09:52 <~ben> that's what it is
09:52 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> also I am just wondering how much stuff do you include in your bot @khuxkm
09:52 <~ben> khuxkm can you push the quotes.tilde.team code
09:53 <@khuxkm> tbh just put whatever you want
09:53 <@khuxkm> in your bot
09:53 <@khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW
09:53 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ik
09:53 <@khuxkm> ben: sure
09:53 <~ben> thx
09:53 <~ben> i'll have a pr for you shortly
09:53 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> but just wondering cause well I have 7 lines of require()
09:54 <~ben> not bad
09:54 <@khuxkm> ben
09:54 <~ben> khuxkm
09:54 <@khuxkm> it won't let me push
09:54 <~ben> what
09:54 <@khuxkm> did you change the name of the repo
09:55 <~ben> meta/quotes
09:55 <~ben> i just tried to add you as contributor
09:55 <~ben> but you're already in the org
09:55 <@khuxkm> i don't have push perms
09:55 <@khuxkm> :P
09:55 <~ben> hmmst
09:56 <~ben> let me check
09:56 <@khuxkm> "remote: User permisiion denies"
09:56 <@khuxkm> s/isii/isi/
09:56 < sedbot> <khuxkm> "remote: User permision denies"
09:56 <@khuxkm> s/denies/denied/
09:56 < sedbot> <khuxkm> "remote: User permisiion denied"
09:56 <@khuxkm> ffs
09:56 <@khuxkm> oh well
09:57 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> where did ii come from in permission tho
09:57 <~ben> This team grants Write access: members can read from and push to the team's repositories.
09:57 <~ben> that's the group you were in
09:57 <~ben> weird
09:57 <@khuxkm> I'm in the owner group too
09:57 <~ben> do you have your ssh key added to gitea?
09:57 <~ben> hmmst
09:58 <@khuxkm> I use https push
09:58 <@khuxkm> it worked now
09:58 <~ben> ew https
09:58 <~ben> stop that
09:58 <@khuxkm> you stop that
09:58 <@khuxkm> https works
09:58 <~ben> ye
09:58 <~ben> ssh is bettter
09:58 <@khuxkm> and I don't have to give anyone my pubkey
09:59 <~ben> i mean
09:59 <~ben> it's your pubkey
09:59 <@khuxkm> what can ssh do that http can't
09:59 <~ben> that's the whole point
09:59 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> why would one like to mess around with keys if you can use https
09:59 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> 😃
09:59 <@khuxkm> other than let git through to a ~ box
10:00 <@khuxkm> another thing you probably don't like about me: I use tabs
10:00 <~ben> keys are so much easiter
10:00 <~ben> s/t//
10:00 < sedbot> <ben> keys are so much easier
10:01 <~ben> let get through to a ~ box?
10:01 <~ben> it's on the ~ box
10:01 <@khuxkm|lounge> what's hard about typing in a username/password combo
10:01 <~ben> i don't want to do that
10:01 <~ben> done that enough times in my life
10:01 <@khuxkm|lounge> ben: I'm referring to, for example, tilde.town, where there isn't any git hosting
10:02 <~ben> ah
10:02 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> okay I have supplied my http auth details to it ages ago and it never asks me again soo i dont see a problem with that
10:02 <~ben> then just make a throwaway key 
10:02 <~ben> revoke it if you need
10:02 <@khuxkm|lounge> also, life hack: register your remote as "https://username.password@git.hosting.network/etc/etc"
10:03 <@khuxkm|lounge> the credentials go through and you only have to type user/pass once
10:03 <~ben> oh gosh that's even worse
10:03 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I always do username@host
10:03 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> only need password when pushing
10:03 <~ben> then your password is plaintext in .git/config
10:03 <@khuxkm|lounge> `chmod 600 .git/*`
10:03 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> its my local system why should I care so much
10:04 <~ben> cause
10:04 <@khuxkm|lounge> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10:04 <~ben> ssh is better
10:09 <@khuxkm> !reload
10:09 -!- minerbot2 [minerbot2@127.0.0.1] has quit [Client exited]

10:09 < minerbot2> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
10:09 < jan6|home> (mosh does wrap ssh though)
10:10 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I want to find some way to make the irc bot fail
10:10 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> too bad I dont have a userbot rn
10:11 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> to send a message that has nothing but an embed
10:11 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> and see the relay reaction
10:12 <@khuxkm|lounge> userbots are against Discord rules :P
10:12 <@khuxkm|lounge> plus, if anything it'd just say
10:12 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> i know
10:12 <@khuxkm|lounge> <~FreeAppSW> 
10:12 <@khuxkm|lounge> like that
10:13 -!- Netsplit team.tilde.chat <-> your.tilde.chat quits: deepend
10:13 <@khuxkm|lounge> tilde.chat website, but with header/footer setup
10:14 <@khuxkm|lounge> https://khuxkm.tilde.team/tchat/
10:14 <~ben> ay nice
10:14 <@khuxkm> rip yourtilde node
10:14 <@khuxkm> netsplit
10:15 <@khuxkm> btw, the point of making the header was so I could add a navbar
10:15 <@khuxkm> and it would appear on this page and any further pages
10:15 <~ben> ofc :)
10:17 <@khuxkm> t:meta/tilde.chat ?
10:17 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> const d = require("discord.js"); const discord = new d.Client();  discord.on("message", (message) => {     if(message.author.id == discord.user.id && message.content == "==>"){         let rembed = new d.RichEmbed().setTitle("Hello").setDescription("World");         message.channel.send("", {embed: rembed});     } }); discord.login("none-of-your-business") I hope this will work okay
10:17 <@khuxkm> get out with your fancy remote stuff
10:18 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ==>
10:18 <~ben> t: is an alias for git@tilde.team
10:18 <@khuxkm> well, I can't pull it down
10:18 <@khuxkm> so that sucks
10:18 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> so what has just happened?
10:18 <~ben> i just updated it
10:18 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> when I sent this arrow thing?
10:19 <~ben> what about the arrow
10:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> http://000-default.co.nf/mbp-5b2a626349efe
10:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> "WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!"
10:19 <~ben> wot
10:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> :P
10:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I made a selfbot to see how does discord-irc handle empty messages
10:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> what's the config option to change it to not strict-check
10:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> with embed
10:20 <~ben> wth why does root on .git/FETCH_HEAD
10:20 <~ben> s/on/own
10:20 < sedbot> <ben> wth why does root own .git/FETCH_HEAD
10:20 <@khuxkm|lounge> @~FreeAppSW try `[]()` (empty link) as the text part of the message
10:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> it wont work
10:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> discord doesnt allow masked links in message content
10:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> only for webhook or embed
10:21 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> {$text}
10:21 -!- Irssi: Window is not sticky anymore
10:22 <@khuxkm> ben: it still won't let me
10:22 <@khuxkm> since it's owned by your usergroup
10:23 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> khuxkm are you okay with jumping between different accounts like this lol?
10:23 <~ben> ok i chowned it to ben:www-data
10:24 <@khuxkm> ...but I'm not in www-data
10:24 <~ben> oh
10:24 <~ben> um
10:24 <@khuxkm> "error: cannot open .git/FETCH_HEAD: Permission denied"
10:24 <~ben> ok now you own it
10:25 <~ben> khuxkm:www-data
10:27 <@khuxkm> for PHP, if I want to have a default for a variable (say, for a customizable header)
10:28 <@khuxkm> is it "<?=$var??'default'>"?
10:28 <~ben> $var ?? 'default'
10:28 <~ben> yeah
10:29 <~ben> https://git.tilde.team/meta/site/src/branch/master/header.php#L10
10:31 <@khuxkm> "syntax error, unexpected '<' in /home/khuxkm/public_html/tchat/header.php on line 5"
10:31 <@khuxkm> ?
10:32 <@khuxkm> @~FreeAppSW you get used to it tbh
10:32 <~ben> you didn't close the php thing
10:32 <~ben> should be <?=$title ?? 'irc network for tildes'?>
10:32 <~ben> don't need parens
10:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> khuxkm used to what?
10:35 <@khuxkm> >khuxkm are you okay with jumping between different accounts like this lol?
10:35 <@khuxkm> you get used to it
10:35 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ah
10:35 <~ben> at least you have the same nick on both
10:36 <@khuxkm> as in, you get used to being logged in in multiple placess
10:36 <@khuxkm> s/ss/s
10:36 < sedbot> <khuxkm> as in, you get used to being logged in in multiple places
10:36 <~ben> khuxkm try out /ms
10:38 <@khuxkm> what's the point of sending memos to channels
10:38 <@khuxkm> :P
10:38 <@khuxkm> also, cool
10:38 <~ben> so someone can see it once they log in
10:38 <~ben> like if they weren't connected
10:38 <~ben> thx anope
10:39 <~ben> i figured out how to get the /ns /cs /os /hs /ms aliases set up last night :)
10:39 <@khuxkm> every time someone says anope I forget, for a brief moment, that that's a services package
10:39 <~ben> ahhhh nope
10:39 <~ben> anope
10:39 <@khuxkm> and, for a brief moment, I laugh
10:39 <~ben> lmao
10:39 <~ben> 1 brief moment
10:39 <~ben> not a boxers moment
10:40 <@khuxkm> no, not a boxer moment

10:46 <@khuxkm|lounge> that'show why did it on the wiki
10:46 <@khuxkm|lounge> oh I see
10:46 <~ben> you were in html mode
10:46 <@khuxkm|lounge> also, that message came out wrong since I was speedtyping
10:46 <~ben> so it didn't even try to interpolate that string
10:46 <~ben> :)

10:55 <~ben> khuxkm how do you run the quotes app
10:55 <~ben> python app.py?
10:55 <@khuxkm> FLASK_APP=app flask run
10:55 <@khuxkm> add FLASK_DEBUG=1 at the beginning to run in debug mode
10:56 <~ben> lol yeah that was not anything that i would have guessed
10:58 <@khuxkm> I used to make my flask apps self-run but there's a perfectly good dev tool that can auto-update the app without me killing it and restarting

11:12 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> great
11:12 <~ben> no u
11:12 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> you cannot send messages to this channel, you are banned
11:13 <~ben> what
11:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> idk
11:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> what may be wrong?
11:13 <~ben> what channel
11:13 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> meta on irc
11:13 <~ben> oh
11:14 <~ben> khuxkm banned you at one point
11:15 <~ben> lemme unban you
11:15 <~ben> i think it was just to show an example
11:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> oh
11:15 <~ben> but it wasn't very nice
11:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> he was showing me how bans work
11:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ye
11:15 -!- mode/#meta [-b freeappsw!*@*] by ChanServ
11:15 <@khuxkm|lounge> i undid that ban tho
11:15 <@khuxkm|lounge> I sent "mode -b freeappsw"
11:15 <~ben> try now
11:15 <@khuxkm|lounge> multiple times
11:15 <~ben> oh
11:15 <~ben> did you do it with chanserv though?
11:16 <@khuxkm|lounge> so it wasn't for a lack of trying
11:16 <@khuxkm|lounge> with chanserv?
11:16 <~ben> fair
11:16 <~ben> @~FreeAppSW try now
11:17 < freeappsw> Test
11:17 < freeappsw> Okay works
11:17 < freeappsw> Thanks
11:17 <~ben> 👍
11:17 <~ben> ✌✌✌✌✌
11:18 < freeappsw> What does owner mean here btw?
11:18 <@khuxkm|lounge> ben: how do you unban someone with chanserv
11:18 <~ben> khuxkm|lounge: /cs unban #chan nick
11:18 <@khuxkm|lounge> I only found a command that lets AOPs unban themselves
11:18 <~ben> owner is the person who first registered the channel
11:18 <~ben> hmm
11:19 <~ben> usually easier to just let chanserv do it
11:19 <~ben> cause it's persistent
11:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> https://www.anope.org/docgen/1.8/en_us/ChanServ.html
11:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> the UNBAN command in particular
11:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> there isn't a documented argument for a nick to unban
11:19 <~ben> ah that's outdated
11:19 <@khuxkm|lounge> just for an AOP to remove bans
11:19 <~ben> i think we have anope v2
11:20 <~ben> lemme check
11:21 <~ben> yeah it's 2.0.6
11:21 <@khuxkm> let me try something real quick
11:21  * khuxkm is listening to Blood on the Risers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWgsdexkv18)

11:27 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #meta to: general for tilde.chat

11:29 < freeappsw> This client has channel mentions
11:29 <~ben> which client are you using freeappsw
11:29 < freeappsw> Irc cloud for now
11:29 <~ben> o
11:30 <~ben> btw you should register your nick with nickserv
11:30 < freeappsw> Already did?
11:30 <~ben> try: /ns help register
11:30 <~ben> oh ok you did
11:30 <~ben> cool
11:30 < freeappsw> Wait /ns?
11:30 < freeappsw> Hmmm
11:30 <~ben> yeah it's an alias for /msg nickserv
11:30 <~ben> same thing
11:30 <~ben> same for /cs /ms /hs /os 
11:30 < freeappsw> I guess problems with my connection or with irc cloud but some messages take much longer to get sent
11:31 <~ben> irccloud was down earlier
11:31 < freeappsw> Also what is chanserv?
11:31 <~ben> service that helps you manage channels
11:31 <~ben> and modes on them
11:32 -!- ChanServ [services@services.tilde.chat] has joined #meta
11:32 -!- mode/#meta [+ao ChanServ ChanServ] by ChanServ
11:32 < freeappsw> I like this client cause it looks just like the discord app
11:32 < freeappsw> Admin? Op?
11:32 <@khuxkm|lounge> !gitea pull meta tilde.chat 1
11:32 < minerbot2> Pull request #1: "$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] already has leading slash" by Ben Harris: https://git.tilde.team/meta/tilde.chat/pulls/1
11:33 < freeappsw> Oh yes why I came here. Lemme try
11:33 < freeappsw> !gitea pull meta/tilde.chat 999
11:33 < minerbot2> An error occurred.
11:33 < freeappsw> Hmmm
11:33 < freeappsw> Good
11:33 < freeappsw> I though it would crash
11:33 <~ben> there has only been on pr so far there lol
11:33 < freeappsw> I know
11:33 < freeappsw> I just try to break the bot
11:33 < freeappsw> Lol
11:34 <~ben> chanserv can do a lot
11:34 <~ben> holy poops
11:35 <~ben> so can operserv
11:35 <@khuxkm> :P
11:35 < freeappsw> Wait what, python doesn’t have a proper way to stop the process?
11:35 <~ben> i hadn't auth'd with operserv before last night
11:35 <~ben> and it has tons of shtuff
11:36 <@khuxkm> until it was brought to my attention by l4p1n, I mean, you could crash the app by just not giving a subcommand for !su
11:36 <@khuxkm> now it defaults to !su help
11:36 < l4p1n> freeappsw: yep, just ^C it
11:37 < freeappsw> So irc doesn’t have any way to identify the message author
11:37 < l4p1n> yes
11:37 < l4p1n> it has
11:37 < freeappsw> So owner-only commands are impossible
11:37 < freeappsw> In bots
11:37 < l4p1n> you can, but what if others inpersonate you ? ^^
11:37 < freeappsw> Yes yes
11:38 <@khuxkm|lounge> that's why none of my bots are set up as services
11:38 < freeappsw> So I won’t even try to find an eval command in this bot
11:38 <@khuxkm|lounge> if my screen session (which reserves my username) dies, so does the bot
11:39 <@khuxkm> ben: fix the link in meta/site/wiki then
11:39 <@khuxkm> I'll fix it in ~chat
11:40 <~ben> Which link
11:40 <~ben> Also khuxkm try botserv
11:40 <@khuxkm> the leading slash thing
11:41 <~ben> URL looks fine there
11:41 <~ben> IDK 
11:41 <@khuxkm> really?
11:41 <@khuxkm> 'cause I copy-pasted from the wiki when I did it
11:43 <~ben> https://git.tilde.team/meta/site/src/branch/master/wiki/index.php#L25
11:43 <~ben> Nvm
11:43 <~ben> Will fix shortly
11:43 <~ben> It's fine for the single wiki page view
11:43 <~ben> But the index page is wrong
11:46 < freeappsw> Btw do we really need that VCs in discord?
11:47 <@khuxkm> VCs?
11:48 < freeappsw> Voice channels
11:49 <@khuxkm> ben: does loading JSON in PHP require any extra libs?
11:50 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> No
11:50 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> json_encode() and json_decode($
11:50 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> ()*
11:51 <@khuxkm> so for a JSON file "aaa.json", "json_decode(file_get_contents('aaa.json'));"?
11:52 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Yes
11:52 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Will provide you an object
11:54 <@khuxkm> so to get a specific key, json_decode(file_get_contents('aaa.json'))['key'];?
11:55 < l4p1n> not exactly
11:55 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> If you set second parameter of json decode to true then yes
11:55 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Otherwise ->key
11:55 <@khuxkm|lounge> why the difference though?
11:56 < l4p1n> one is for more OO style and the other if you prefer arrays
11:56 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Sometimes an associative array is more handy to use
11:56 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Sometimes an object
11:57 <@khuxkm> how can I check to see that the file was retrieved?
11:58 < l4p1n> by checking file_get_contents return
11:58 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> What do you mean check?
11:59 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And if the file will fail to read iirc you get a warning
11:59 <@khuxkm|lounge> I don't want it to give a warning
11:59 <@khuxkm|lounge> I want to know when it happens in the page itself
11:59 <@khuxkm|lounge> so I can show a little "sorry" blurb
12:00 <~ben> sorry bub
12:01 <~ben> i usually just do json_decode(file_get_contents("filename.json"))
12:01 <~ben> or you can put a url in file_get_contents
12:01 <~ben> it's a nice method
12:03 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Isn’t that what we already have?
12:04 <~ben> i'm not sure where we're talking about json_decode and such
12:04 <@khuxkm> how can I iterate over a list
12:04 <~ben> but if it's the wiki, i just make sure that the file exists before i open it
12:04 <~ben> foreach ($var as $key => $value)
12:04 <~ben> works for everything
12:04 <@khuxkm|lounge> it's a list, not an array
12:05 <@khuxkm|lounge> well, not a named item array
12:05 <~ben> foreach ($var as $value)
12:05 <~ben> the $key => thing is optional
12:05 <~ben> if it's a normal list (integer keys), $key will just have the index
12:05 <@khuxkm> so `foreach($members as $member)`
12:05 <~ben> yuyp
12:05 <@khuxkm> and I put a codeblock after it
12:05 <@khuxkm> right?
12:05 <~ben> foreach ($list_or_array as $index_or_key => $current_item)
12:05 <~ben> yeah {}
12:06 <@khuxkm> try and guess what I'm working on
12:06 <~ben> going through either the json from the git{ea,hub} api or 
12:06 <~ben> something for the irc page
12:07 <@khuxkm|lounge> ding ding! it's the IRC page
12:07 <~ben> what json are you getting
12:07 <@khuxkm|lounge> making an API for it (going to be `https://tilde.chat/members.json`)
12:07 <@khuxkm|lounge> just a local file
12:08 <~ben> if it's php you might as well just make it spit it out on demand
12:08 <~ben> otherwise you will have to bother with setting up a cron job
12:08 <@khuxkm> echo doesn't put a trailing newline, does it?
12:08 <~ben> no it doesn't
12:08 <~ben> well it does if you're doing it on a cli
12:08 <~ben> but in html no
12:08 <@khuxkm> ben: it's literally just a static JSON
12:09 <~ben> what's in it
12:09 <~ben> irc users or bots?
12:09 <@khuxkm> not in this file
12:09 <@khuxkm> that'll be for a stats page
12:09 <~ben> oh the members of the tilde.chat network
12:09 <~ben> noie
12:09 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It doesn’t on the CLI?
12:09 <@khuxkm> what else did you think $members meant
12:09 <~ben> s/e/ce
12:09 < sedbot> <ben> noice
12:09 <~ben> idk what i was thinking
12:09 <~ben> ignore me i'm dumb
12:10 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Will you run a bot to see member count?
12:10 <~ben> oh i guess it doesn't
12:10 <~ben> nvm
12:10 <~ben> PHP_EOL is a magic constant that you can use and it will spit out the right eol for the platform it's running on
12:10 <~ben> my last job ran php from iis
12:11 <~ben> it was Bad™
12:13 <@khuxkm> alright
12:14 <@khuxkm> after a few minutes of work, my local version is now feature-complete with the deployed version
12:14 <@khuxkm> my next commit after this will make the site start using tabs instead of quadspaces
12:14 <@khuxkm> since that' easier for me to navigate
12:15 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm why do people get that mad when we announce that our new bot will have paid tiers and will be closed source (about our team on my guild)
12:15 <@khuxkm> because that's not cool >:(
12:16 <@khuxkm> close-source is only a good idea if you're insecure about how bad your spaghetti code is (see: OG minerbot)
12:16 <@khuxkm> s/close/closed
12:16 < sedbot> <khuxkm> closed-source is only a good idea if you're insecure about how bad your spaghetti code is (see: OG minerbot)
12:16 < jan6|home> ^
12:17 < jan6|home> paid = it's so good people are willing to throw hard-earned money at it
12:17 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Okay but that bot will be a service
12:17 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Not just a bot
12:17 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It will give your guild a lot  of automation and a web panel to tweak it
12:17 < jan6|home> closed-source = so good people will trust that it's supposed to be secure and that you fix any flaws asap
12:17 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And it will be free for most purposes
12:18 <~ben> maybe leave it open source and charge for the service
12:19 < jan6|home> you can always have only the core be free, so if you use the free version you get basically unstyled html, and such stuff
12:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Tfw you don’t understand wha stuff means
12:19 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387272314863091713/459029533585178634/image.png
12:19 < jan6|home> lol
12:19 <~ben> https://changelog.com/podcast/300
12:20 < jan6|home> "why's there no Artist Daily?" would be an appropriate response
12:20 <~ben> this was a really interesting podcast 
12:20 <~ben> it's the learn x the hard way guy
12:20 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> hmmm
12:20 < jan6|home> podcast? ain't-nobody-got-time-for-that!
12:20 <~ben> and he talks a lot about how open source is expensive to make
12:21 <~ben> and that it shouldn't be bad for open source devs to want to get paid
12:21 < jan6|home> the trick is to make stuff so good people are willing to pay you even though they don't have to
12:22 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I mean Artist is a discord bot, what kind of beta and nightly builds...
12:23 <@khuxkm> also
12:23 <@khuxkm> >why do people get that mad when we announce that our new bot will have paid tiers
12:23 < jan6|home> or you could do the smart way of "you get something, but it's nowhere near as polished and pretty as the premium version, also we have custom (templates|brushes|characters|something) over here, plus we'll help you if you get stuck
12:23 <@khuxkm> did the old bot have paid tiers
12:23 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> No
12:23 <@khuxkm> there's your problem then
12:24 < jan6|home> free users don't like paid, and paid users think of free as inferior
12:24 <@khuxkm> you're telling people that they aren't going to get as much from the new bot as the old one unless they pay up
12:24 <@khuxkm> of course they're going to be miffed about it
12:24 <@khuxkm> miffed? is that a word?
12:25 <@khuxkm|lounge> it is
12:25 <@khuxkm|lounge> an informal verb, but a word nonetheless
12:25 <@khuxkm|lounge> perhaps irked would be a better word to use there
12:28 <~ben> miffed makes sense
12:28 <~ben> i knew what you meant with it
12:28 <~ben> https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible
12:28 <~ben> this is really cool ^^
12:29 <@khuxkm> PHP question: how can I get the length of a list?
12:29 <@khuxkm> https://avivace.github.io/awesome-gbdev
12:29 <@khuxkm> ^ even cooler (I'm totally not biased :P) ^
12:30 <@khuxkm|lounge> I'm totally not a part of the group that puts that together, what are you talking about? (/s)
12:30 <~ben> count($arr)
12:31 <~ben> lol khuxkm|lounge you only have one commit
12:33 <@khuxkm|lounge> ?
12:34 <@khuxkm|lounge> I mean, I'm at least trying to make myself involved
12:34 <@khuxkm|lounge> it's your fault for letting me make the website :P
12:34 <@khuxkm|lounge> oh wait
12:34 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Hmmm
12:34 <~ben> lol what 
12:34 <@khuxkm|lounge> wow I misread that
12:35 <@khuxkm|lounge> I though you were talking about putting myself down as a sysadmin
12:35 <@khuxkm|lounge> I have one commit and (unrelatedly) have one resource on the list
12:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Okay that drama about paid bot eventually turned into everyone wanting to ban that guy who always said nonsense things especially about the bot
12:36 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> It already is worth getting a popcorn
12:37 <@khuxkm> i wish I could send you a bag of popcorn
12:37 <@khuxkm> (like, a bag of popcorn IRL)
12:37 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Ik
12:38  * khuxkm popcorn
12:38 <@khuxkm> ^t the closes thing I have
12:38 <@khuxkm> s/t the/ the/
12:38 < sedbot> <khuxkm> ^ the closes thing I have
12:38 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Well tbh it is my guild but I have crap a lot staff members so let me see are they even worth it
12:39 <@khuxkm|lounge> now the sysadmins are listed and the private channel is too
12:39 <@khuxkm|lounge> https://tilde.team/~khuxkm/tchat/
12:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Oof
12:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387272314863091713/459034833100865536/image.png
12:40 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Okay I’ll stop
12:41 <@khuxkm|lounge> no, keep going
12:41 <@khuxkm|lounge> :P
12:41 <~ben> nice
12:41 <~ben> lol
12:41 <@khuxkm|lounge> I want to see where this goes :P
12:41 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387272314863091713/459035013502074900/image.png
12:41 <~ben> does the members list read from members.json or something?
12:41 <@khuxkm|lounge> i feel ashamed to have been born a year before that kid
12:42 <@khuxkm|lounge> ben: ye
12:42 <~ben> dang khuxkm|lounge i wouldn't have guessed you're so young
12:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Then stuff got a little more boring
12:42 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> And they switched to discussing the python “os” that kid was making
12:43 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Also I can eventually make a book of his copypastas and make millions jk
12:44 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Stuff that he says to try to prove Windows is the best os is just
12:44 <~ben> lol windows best os
12:44 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> I don’t know what word to use, this is how
12:44 <~ben> what a joke
12:45 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> “I have tried Ubuntu and I didn’t like it, even my mum didn’t like it! No wonder I don’t use Linux nor macOS!” etc
12:45 <~ben> wow what a good argument
12:46 <~ben> bulletproof
12:46 <~ben> bulletproof logic you got there
12:46 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/387272314863091713/459036433546739733/image.png
12:47 <~ben> makes total sense
12:48 < tildebridge> <~FreeAppSW> Also the reason he has this nickname is because the developer of Rin bot has blacklisted him from the bot cause of abusing and making fun of features
12:50 <@khuxkm> this thunder guy seems like a dickwad
12:52 <@khuxkm|lounge> https://tilde.team/~khuxkm/tchat/
12:52 <~ben> looks good
12:52 <@khuxkm|lounge> @~FreeAppSW he and I can trade parents then
12:53 <@khuxkm|lounge> 'cause I'd rather have my asthma be worse than stop using linux
12:53 <@khuxkm|lounge> and my parents stopped smoking a few years ago
