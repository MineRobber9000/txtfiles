09:49 -!- Irssi: Starting query in tildechat with sillyfanboy
09:49 <sillyfanboy> what am i talking to children and have to explain every word i use to describe something?
09:49 <sillyfanboy> fuck
09:49 <sillyfanboy> >how is it weird
09:49 <sillyfanboy> i don't have to explain why i use weird
09:49 <sillyfanboy> it an imo
09:59 <khuxkm> well he wants to know why that is your opinion
09:59 <sillyfanboy> i stated
09:59 <sillyfanboy> probably in a un tasteful way but still
10:23 <sillyfanboy> see i wasn't wrong
10:24 <sillyfanboy> i can smell someone character like a mile away
10:24 <sillyfanboy> i wasn't trying to tell him like you can't do it
10:24 <sillyfanboy> but when we already have our own list with up to date info
10:24 <sillyfanboy> just contribute to those
10:25 <sillyfanboy> if for some reason they were un maintained id see a point
10:25 <sillyfanboy> but then he brought the argument of tildes
00:51 <sillyfanboy> i feel bad for saying that to login but i hope he gets some help and maybe diagnosed at some point
00:52 <sillyfanboy> i feel like i fucked up in some way but gbmor and nobody told me so
00:52 <sillyfanboy> gbmor said i didn't mess up
01:09 <khuxkm> "quebec is the north korea of france" is a bit much don't you think?
01:10 <sillyfanboy> then when they say im racist
01:10 <sillyfanboy> don't you think that over board too?
01:10 <sillyfanboy> you can't be racist toward quebecs
01:10 <sillyfanboy> their french not a whole race
01:11 <sillyfanboy> their based offof french
01:11 <khuxkm> but still
01:12 <khuxkm> racist isn't the right word, I'll give you that
01:12 <khuxkm> but just dismissing an entire culture as "the north korea of france"
01:12 <khuxkm> when it's not even in France
01:12 <sillyfanboy> june should also be brought
01:13 <sillyfanboy> im not racist
01:13 <sillyfanboy> for saying that even remotely
01:13 <sillyfanboy> maybe tasteless
01:13 <sillyfanboy> but not racist
01:13 <sillyfanboy> nobody mentions the shit june said
01:13 <sillyfanboy> june has gone on rants to that aren't relevent
01:14 <sillyfanboy> bring up june if your going to bring up anyone because they made this bigger then it could be
01:15 <sillyfanboy> because they seem to be pissy with anyone who they disagree with
01:16 <sillyfanboy> nobody in the convo mentioned june
01:16 <sillyfanboy> instead they sided with them
01:16 <sillyfanboy> maybe i should just fucking quit irc
01:16 <sillyfanboy> because when ever i voice a opinion it no different then other networks
01:16 <sillyfanboy> people dog pile on me constantly
