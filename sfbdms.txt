22:13 <sillyfanboy> i had sebastian came to me about me being "Toxic" towards brendo should i paste the log?
22:35 <khuxkm> sure
22:35 <sillyfanboy> im giving him about 30 more mins to write a paragraph
22:35 <sillyfanboy> but if you want me to paste the log ill do so
22:36 <sillyfanboy> the complete log
22:36 <khuxkm> I would say it's arguably not sebastian's place to say anything but don't quote me on that
22:36 <khuxkm> sure paste it
22:36 <khuxkm> if he sends a paragraph after you paste the log then just tell me
22:36 <sillyfanboy> ill let you know
22:37 <sillyfanboy> ttm.sh is fine or?
22:38 <sillyfanboy> https://ttm.sh/QBi.log
22:39 <sillyfanboy> complete log un cut
22:39 <sillyfanboy> if he sends a paragraph ill let you know
22:43 <khuxkm> what was this in response to again?
22:43 <sillyfanboy> what i said in #meta about brendo
22:43 <sillyfanboy> apparently speaking your mind is "toxic"
22:44 <khuxkm> >were as i get banned because i asked for it
22:44 <sillyfanboy> oh
22:44 <khuxkm> to be fair you did literally ask us to ban you
22:44 <khuxkm> but whatever
22:44 <sillyfanboy> yeah but you know
22:44 <khuxkm> I'm reading through it
22:44 <sillyfanboy> wasn't given a fair chance to calm down
22:45 <khuxkm> true
22:45 <sillyfanboy> brendo has been given years to calm down and coming back even after 3 strike
22:45 <khuxkm> >have u talked to the admins?
22:45 <sillyfanboy> right
22:45 <khuxkm> ...don't really need to go into it with you on why that isn't exactly an easy thing
22:45 <khuxkm> tell you what, I'll message sebastian a few things
22:46 <sillyfanboy> that the complete log
22:46 <sillyfanboy> i did not edit anything
22:46 <sillyfanboy> i gave him 30 mins so far to give me anything
22:47 <sillyfanboy> then i said to him you have about 30 more mins dude
22:47 <sillyfanboy> and then i decided ah fuck it ill just send it to a op
22:48 <sillyfanboy> he trying to op like he knows the situation
22:48 <sillyfanboy> like if fossy or ubergeek or someone else came to me
22:48 <sillyfanboy> id get it
22:48 <sillyfanboy> but as far as i know i don't know who sebastian is
22:48 <khuxkm> yeah, that's not his place to say anything about the situation
22:48 <khuxkm> I also don't know who sebastian is
22:48 <sillyfanboy> and he hasn't said anything in meta or anywhere else
22:49 <sillyfanboy> i don't get how im being toxic
22:49 <khuxkm> well he's in there
22:49 <sillyfanboy> maybe i can tone it down
22:49 <sillyfanboy> but
22:49 <khuxkm> so basically he's trying to say "you're insulting him; even if he insulted you, insulting him makes for a toxic environment"
22:49 <khuxkm> but that's in his eyes
22:49 <sillyfanboy> yeah
22:50 <khuxkm> if we truly felt like having you and brendo catfighting made for a toxic environment we'd have done something about it by now
22:50 <sillyfanboy> i haven't heard anyone go up to me or an op even say anything to me
22:50 <khuxkm> I mean, we did something about TE and he was just being a douchebag in general
22:50 <sillyfanboy> he even said something suicidal joke
22:50 <sillyfanboy> i don't say shit like that
22:50 <sillyfanboy> i can't see even if i was being rude to brendo
22:50 <sillyfanboy> that i have said something like that
22:51 <sillyfanboy> esp since i came back
22:51 <sillyfanboy> if anything
22:51 <sillyfanboy> ive been trying to be nothing but nice
22:51 <sillyfanboy> esp to people who have rub me the wrong way
22:52 <sillyfanboy> im not trying or am i creating a toxic env
22:52 <sillyfanboy> if i do let me know and ill try to take a break and game or do something
22:52 <sillyfanboy> something else
22:53 <khuxkm> I don't see this being something that leads to a toxic environment
22:54 <khuxkm> besides brendo is kind of a douchebag at times
22:54 <khuxkm> (but don't tell anyone I said that :V)
22:54 <sillyfanboy> but if you guys let me know or what ever gender
22:54 <sillyfanboy> sorry
22:54 <sillyfanboy> like let me know if im being toxic
22:54 <sillyfanboy> and ill take a break
22:54 <sillyfanboy> and come back with a cleaer head
22:54 <sillyfanboy> i won't say anything
22:54 <khuxkm> it's fine
22:55 <khuxkm> if the opers are complaining I will make sure to let you know
22:55 <khuxkm> but I have forwarded this into the #opers channel
22:55 <khuxkm> can I send them these logs too?
22:55 <sillyfanboy> sure
22:55 <sillyfanboy> send what your fine with
