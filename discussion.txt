20:36 < kumquat> what june said about dehydration and headaches is so true
20:36 < kumquat> if I don't drink enough water I wake up the next morning with a dehydration headache
20:38 < praetor> mspe is a cat?
20:38 < praetor> I find mine are tension headaches
20:38 < kumquat> mspe is a human male
20:38 < kumquat> so far as I'm aware
20:39 < praetor> lol I thought so
20:39 < kumquat> I mean, he's sitting next to me and he doesn't look like a cat?
20:40 < praetor> there was just this guy on a segway putting dent repair ads on people's cars. I bet that is a fun job
20:40 < kumquat> I mean, if you're getting paid to go around on a segway, why not
20:40 < praetor> inorite!?
20:40 < kumquat> but that doesn't sound like a very um... essential job
20:41 < praetor> well, we had golf ball sized hail this morning
20:41 < praetor> so
20:41 < kumquat> oof
20:41 < praetor> you know, and who are we to really say who is essential and whose not. we all need to eat
20:41 < kumquat> das ist nicht sehr guht
20:42 < praetor> no
20:42 <@cmccabe> hey hey hey
20:42 < praetor> heya cmccabe 
20:42 < kumquat> hey cmccabe
20:42 < southerntofu> hey :)
20:42 <@cmccabe> you're supposed to say, "it's faaaat albert"
20:42 < praetor> hey hey, it's faaaaat albert
20:43 <@cmccabe> high five praetor!
20:43 < kumquat> that's either before my time, or something I didn't see because of my parents' ban on tv growing up
20:43  * praetor hi5
20:43 < praetor> it's a bit before your time
20:43 <@cmccabe> i think i saw it on re-runs when i was a kid
20:43 < praetor> I can't remember if I watched re-runs or not
20:44 < kumquat> I was so jealous of my classmates and they're retelling of Alf back in the day
20:44 <@cmccabe> my kid's sea monkeys jar got knocked over today. total sea monkey death. so i'm shopping for more eggs now
20:44 < praetor> awww. that sucks
20:44 <@cmccabe> she cried
20:44 < kumquat> then I actually saw an episode when I was 27 and realized I probably didn't miss out on that much :P
20:44 <@cmccabe> oh yeah, alf sucked
20:44 < praetor> you really didn't. it wasn't a very good series
20:44 < kumquat> oh nooooo that's sad cmccabe
20:45 <@cmccabe> good, old tv shows include mash and welcome back kotter
20:46 < kumquat> but sometimes I do not get pop culture references from the 80s because we weren't allowed watching TV and my mom only blasted NPR, classical music, and occasionally folk music from all 4 corners of the house
20:47 < praetor> I don't remember too many cartoons from that era. my mom didn't have a prohabition on TV. we just didn't watch it. my sister and I were more interested in books
20:47 < praetor> my mom really pushed literacy and mastery of the english language on us
20:47 < kumquat> yuuuup. Books were always my escape
20:47 < praetor> yeah :D
20:48 < kumquat> it was the one thing that my mom would always buy for us without question basically
20:48 < praetor> sarah was into fairytales, and I was into the myths
20:49 < praetor> we don't have a tv
20:49 < praetor> I mean, we have prime and netflix
20:49 < praetor> but no cable or no tv even
20:49 < kumquat> ooooh I had a period where I was really into reading myths as a teenager
20:49 < praetor> :D
20:49 < kumquat> then I got into dystopian science fiction
20:50 < praetor> I wanted to learn sumerian sooooo bad, but in the 80s and 90s, learning a language that only 15 people in the entire world are fluent at was difficult
20:50 < kumquat> yeah, TV was the first thing I got rid of when I broke up with my ex. Do not miss it.
20:50 < praetor> we have our kindle fires we watch shows on
20:51 < kumquat> haaaaah, I wanted to learn Greek and Latin. But my school didn't even have a successful German language program.
20:51  * praetor nods
20:51 < hackintech> blagh
20:52 < hackintech> I want coffee
20:52 < kumquat> I took French and German and everyone treated me like a weirdo because I voluntarily signed up for a second foreign language
20:52 < praetor> I'm having coffee. I can't decide if I want another cup or not
20:52  * kumquat hands hackintech a vat of cold brew
20:52 < praetor> my hot neighbor is working on his truck
20:52 < praetor> which is mildly
20:52 < praetor> erotic
20:53 < kumquat> LOL
20:53 < ensa> uh
20:53 < praetor> he was walking about without a shirt on
20:53 < faff> yeah but how hot is the truck

21:00 < ensa> hi anelki
21:00 < praetor> okay. my downstairs neighbor, from colorado, is smoking weed. colorado weed
21:00 < anelki> how're you?
21:00 < june> for some reason I still remember the episode of Franklin where they play a sport and someone calls "foul" and some bird is like "did you just call me a fowl"
21:00 < praetor> colorado weed does not smell like rotting homeless person
21:00 < kumquat> send me some praetor
21:00 < ensa> im fine i guess, kind of vaguely anxious
21:00 < praetor> it's smells almost sagebrushy
21:00 < ensa> howre you anelki
21:00 < kumquat> pleeeeeease
21:00 < kumquat> :D
21:00 < anelki> I'm okay, still have to put clothes away
21:00 < praetor> I'm in texas. if I were still in colorado....we'd figure out how to do that
21:01 < kumquat> lol
21:01 < kumquat> not worth potential jail time
21:01 < cypher> why does everyone live somewhere cool but me 
21:01 < kumquat> but I am jonesing for some good weed. Sigh.
21:01 < cypher> OH i foud a pot farm today 
21:01 < praetor> the stuff hot neighbor smokes is that nasty street weed from god knows where
21:02 < kumquat> gross
21:02 < cypher> i was on my run and about 2 miles in theres a road that ive never run down before 
21:02 < praetor> a buddy is growing some libertarian weed :D
21:02 < cypher> only 3 things there a weed farm a substation and an xfinity wifi tower
21:03 < praetor> sounds perfect
21:03 < cypher> the weed farm is set up like some black military base tho
21:03 < anelki> where are you, cypher?
21:05 < cypher> indiana 
21:06 < cypher> oh when i said black military base i meant private military base
21:06 < kumquat> there are weed farms in Indiana?
21:06 < kumquat> like, legal weed farms?
21:08 < praetor> I doubt it lol
21:09 < cypher> not leagelno
21:09 < cypher> not at alll
21:10 < southerntofu> « private military base » so many things wrong with this world in one sentence lol
21:11 < kumquat> yuuuup
21:12 < kumquat> ah ok. It's just that I was surprised that there'd be a weed farm out there. But I guess the description of it essentially being a private military base makes um... I don't want to sense
21:12 < kumquat> I don't want to say sense*
21:18 < lickthecheese> cypher: report it and the police might pay you for helping them
21:19 < june> don't encourage being a narc
21:20 < ensa> imagine calling the boys in blue, couldnt be me
21:24 < demure> why even bother calling in a weed farm? weed is healthier then cigarettes/alcohol  
21:25 < ensa> the types that always call the cops are legal moralists, they dont care about that
21:25 <~ubergeek> I call ICE on homes I see "Trump 2020" signs on the yard
21:26 < ensa> if you know theyre white thats kinda praxis tho, slowing them down with false alarms
21:26 <~ubergeek> I report them as illegal immigrants, suspected of shipping drugs
21:27 <~ubergeek> occasionally toss in the human trafficking suspcicion
21:29 <~ubergeek> ensa: that's how I see it.  The Trumpers love ICE, ICE loves kicking in doors.
21:29 <~ubergeek> Marriage made in heaven
21:30 <~ubergeek> Plus, it's one immigrant they aren't harassing for the next 6 hours
21:31 < ensa> doing the equivalent of prank calling the gestapo is pretty ballsy tbh

21:32 <~ubergeek> It's kinda like calling the Unamerican Commission on somone organizing a union :P
21:32 <~ubergeek> But, that being said, I take precautions
21:33 < cypher> yea i need to get a pc
21:33 < cypher> ios makes me want to die
21:34 < kumquat> lmao that's amazing ubergeek
21:34 < kumquat> I love it
21:34 < ensa> HUAC was an interesting affair, first-ever federally funded theatre
21:34 < anelki> federal theater project during the depression, ensa?
21:34 < ensa> (court theatre but theatre nonetheless)
21:34 < ensa> o
21:34 < ensa> nvm
21:35 < ensa> i dont care much for american history, i just know a few things here and there, like the 13th amendment not actually abolishing slavery
21:36 < cypher> 2nd amendment best amendmet
21:36 < cypher> and first
21:36 < cypher> and 3rd
21:36 < cypher> hell all of are good
21:36 < ensa> all of the amendments are a sham imo but im not getting into that rn
21:37 < cypher> ensa they really are tho never realy on a government to protct to
21:37 < cypher> *you
21:37 < cypher> people need to watch out for there own rights
21:37 < ensa> that and they all assume the legitimacy of the most brutal settler-colonial project of all time
21:37 <~ubergeek> the only rights you have is what your government, or your resources can protect for you
21:38 < ensa> the narrative of "rights" is one that presumes benevolent government so i dont buy into it
21:38 < cypher> my resouces to protect my rights 
21:38 <~ubergeek> ^^^
21:38 <~ubergeek> what ensa said
21:38 < cypher> 1 12 gauge shotgun 
21:38 < cypher> 200 shells
21:38 < cypher> and a sighn that says no trespacing 
21:38 < cypher> true redneck 
21:39 <~ubergeek> There's a reason why the workers are to be armed:  In order to defend the proletariat from militarism of the bourgeroise
21:39 < lickthecheese> cypher: what does the no tresspassing sign do to prevent tresspassers
21:39 <~ubergeek> one person can only defend so much, and needs to sleep
21:40 <~ubergeek> Hence, the need for the revolutionary guard
21:43 < kumquat> night #meta... or morning I guess
21:44 < cypher> lickthecheese it des nothing

00:59 <~gbmor> nice!
00:59 <~gbmor> are you using a book as a reference
00:59 < ensa> ive got the ANSI C book
00:59 <~gbmor> cool
00:59 < ensa> after i finish it i'll look up the important differences for c99, if there are any
01:00 < ensa> what've you been up to, gbmor?
01:01 <~gbmor> not a whole lot in particular. i've been trying to think of a new project to work on

01:01 < ensa> is ~/public_repos on ~inst still gonna happen or was that a hypothetical
01:02 <~gbmor> hypothetical, but i can start on that actually
01:02 <~gbmor> to see if i can get it to work
01:02 < ensa> i'd definitely use it if it happens
01:02 <~gbmor> awesome! i'll start on it now then. probably won't have an answer for usability till tomorrow since it's late
01:03 < ensa> i've got time :p

01:08 <~gbmor> minor annoyance, having to use gmake instead of bsdmake
01:08 <~gbmor> but oh well
01:08 <~gbmor> mostly an annoyance because it wasn't specified in the readme
01:11 <~deepend> hmm just in random files I've apparently downloaded over 1.2TB so far this month.. lol I should see what my ISP says my current total usage is lol 
01:12 < ensa> you don't get charged by the gigabyte do you
01:12 <~deepend> nope.. no limit.. just interesting to see how much I use these days now since I have no limit
01:12 <~deepend> 1366GB is my total usage so far
01:12 <~deepend> according to my ISP
01:16 <~deepend> december was my highest month in the last year to.. did over 2TB

04:10 < trinary> But you need a pricing calculator in the first place
04:11 <~khuxkm> ?
04:12 < trinary> khuxkm: Other providers have a simpler pricing model, so you don't need a calculator
04:12 <~khuxkm> anyways, switching to digitalocean, I can get 2tb transfer and +18GB storage and cut my costs down to ~$140
04:13 <~khuxkm> switch to porkbun for domain (from domain.com) and save even more (down to ~$128.56)
04:23 <~fossy> or just use hetzner or ovh and get a dirt cheap vps?
04:26 <~khuxkm> huh
04:26 <~khuxkm> tiL
04:26 <~khuxkm> s/ti/TI/
04:26 < sedbot> <khuxkm> TIL
04:26 <~khuxkm> so that's now down to...
04:26 <~khuxkm> ,py (3*12)+(8.56)
04:26 < BitBot> [Python] khuxkm: 44.56
04:27 <~khuxkm> 45 bucks a year
04:27 <~khuxkm> sweet
04:27 <~khuxkm> and that's on Hetzner's lowest tier
04:37 < trinary> ... I said so above :/
04:37 <~khuxkm> I guess part of why I wanted AWS was the freedom to add disk space as I saw fit
04:38 <~khuxkm> as any admin of a tilde server I regularly use can tell you, my home folders are quite large
04:38 <~khuxkm> my ~team home folder is 14GB on its own
04:39 < trinary> You can do that with other providers too, but it's always unreasonably expensive
04:39 <~khuxkm> yeah
04:39 <~khuxkm> meanwhile it's 10 cents a GB on Amazon
04:39 <~khuxkm> maybe I could just buy an S3 bucket or some shit
04:40 < trinary> khuxkm: It's 5 cents per GB with Hetzner
04:40 < trinary> But still, I wouldn't want to store much there
04:41 <~khuxkm> i mean, lowest tier at Hetzner gives me 20GB included
04:41 <~khuxkm> which is enough to hold my ~team home folder
04:41 < trinary> Assuming your system is tiny
04:42 <~khuxkm> ?
04:43 < trinary> It depends on what you want to do with it (duh)
04:43 < trinary> If you need many large toolchains, 20GB isn't going that far
04:43 < trinary> On the other hand, my CX11 only uses 1.6GB, because I don't use it interactively
04:43 < trinary> I don't know what you want to do with it
04:44 <~Kneezle> i'm starting to get the the point that i should have a proper dedi
04:44 <~khuxkm> it would presumably host a website and my IRC client
04:44 <~Kneezle> i'm paying ~$10/month for less that i would be getting
04:44 <~khuxkm> plus I could shell out a little extra for the next tier up and get +30GB
04:44 < trinary> Kneezle: What do you do with it?
04:45 <~khuxkm> which would probably allow me to move some of my shit off of the mc box that b3n so graciously provides for me :P
04:45 < trinary> khuxkm: Did you see the volumes pricing?
04:45 <~Kneezle> well i have a box with XMPP, Wirdpress MUI hosting and Nextcloud.  I also have a jumpbox for pretty much jumping around
04:45 < cano> Microsoft Word
04:45 <~khuxkm> (since he ended lxd container support, and I wanted a small box to host the minecraft server, so I run what i used to run in my lxd on the mc box)
04:45 <~khuxkm> trinary: I did not
04:45 <~Kneezle> Ooo
04:45 <~Kneezle> yeah MC needs resources
04:46 <~khuxkm> especially current versions
04:46 <~khuxkm> like wth

04:47 < BitBot> [Shorturl] Shortened URL: https://ttm.sh/hZS
04:47 <~khuxkm> neat
04:47 < trinary> Kneezle: If it's an option, and you use your NC a lot, hosting at home can be significantly cheaper than paying for much faster storage than you need
04:48 < BitBot> ・゜゜・。。・゜゜\_o< QUACK!

04:48 < trinary> Kneezle: Though any websites with traffic worth mentioning should probably stay out of your home
04:48 <~Kneezle> yeah but the whole point is offsite.  and i'm getting 120GB NC for $2.5/month
04:48 <~Kneezle> that VPS was a sweetass deal

04:54 < jan6> khuxkm: you do know you can add on volumes at hetzner and most other places? ;P I have 20gb + extra 20gb, on the cheapest hetzner, and it's all just ~4€
04:54 < trinary> Kneezle: That's fair, and sounds like a good deal
04:54 < trinary> jan6: Yes, I told them
04:54 < trinary> (twice)
04:54 < jan6> I didn't see a response to that ;P

04:55 <~Kneezle> yeah it was a crazy deal with Vultr.  its (sort of) still going on i think, but its $3.5/month now
04:55 < trinary> Kneezle: Is it the ipv6-only one?
04:55 <~Kneezle> I don't want to test it because i'm scared of losing my deal
04:55 <~Kneezle> it wasn't v6 only then
04:55 < trinary> Even better
04:55 <~Kneezle> and they had a deal that block storage was free if you spun up in NJ
04:55 <~Kneezle> which, fuck yes
04:55 <~Kneezle> i did
04:56 <~Kneezle> i dudpect the deal is off
04:56 < trinary> Uh oh
04:56 <~Kneezle> suspect
04:56 <~Kneezle> but they kept me on my plan
04:56 < trinary> It's probably fine, but free things often get discontinued without a lot of notice
04:57 < trinary> And then you need to find a new place for your 120GB till tomorrow, while on vacation
04:58 <~Kneezle> yeahbut thats why its nextcloud - if they yanked it, i have a local backup of everything
04:58 < trinary> You didn't mention a backup before!
04:58 <~Kneezle> nextcloud is like dropbox, it has a local sync client
04:58 < trinary> All fine then :)
05:04 <~Kneezle> <3
05:06 <~khuxkm> "don't spend your entire budget on storage if you want to run a game server off of it" i meant moving the non-mc stuff off of the mc box
05:06 <~khuxkm> so the mc box would still run the tildeverse hardcore MC server
05:07 <~khuxkm> but my personal box could do the rest of the things

09:19 < melyanna> Hi everyone! I've been distracted by work as usual.
09:20 < melyanna> Had to hold an online seminar/lesson/presentation this morning
09:20 < brendo> oof
09:20 < melyanna> I am really shy and not used to speaking in public so staring at my pc helped with that
09:21 < melyanna> however, not being able to see the people attending makes it a bit hard to figure out if they are listening or falling asleep
09:24 < login> melyanna: i actually feel more anxious with online seminar/lesson/presentation than in-person
09:24 < login> in person, i can see if someone's recording my face or not

09:32 < melyanna> anyway
09:33 < melyanna> turns out the chat already existed so he ended up joining a group of women who were baking together
09:33 < brendo> lol
09:34 < melyanna> they looked at him and saif "Either bake with us or leave"
09:34 < melyanna> just like that - they weren't necessarily surprised a random dude would pop up
09:34 < brendo> lmaoooo

14:53 < vantablack> you're right, it's GREAT
14:53 <~khuxkm> $0 a barrel?
14:53 <~khuxkm> what the fuck
14:53 < praetor> hehe anelki 
14:53 <~khuxkm> also, how the fuck do you go below $0?
14:54 < anelki> that's the market saying they're extremely oversupplied
14:54 <~khuxkm> oh, wait, just read the article
14:54 < anelki> https://www.bloomberg.com/energy
14:55 <~khuxkm> basically, because of people not traveling as much (thanks COVID-19!), people aren't buying as much gasoline/oil products
14:55 <~khuxkm> therefore gas stations/motor oil companies aren't needing refills
14:55 < demure> this sounds like a good thing to me
14:55 <~khuxkm> therefore there's just a bunch of crude oil in barrels lying around
14:55 < demure> the USA has been paying way too little for way more units for too long
14:56 <~khuxkm> so apparently they'll pay you to take it? (I guess that's what a price below 0 makes)

14:56 < jess> supply can't stop fast enough
14:56 < demure> khuxkm: USA gasoline prices have been super cheap for gallons, when everywhere else pays a lot more for liters 
14:57 < lickthecheese> oh noes my mom is going to make me mow the lawn again
14:57 < demure> which only makes us even more complacent about figuring out environmentally friendly transportation  
14:57 < rak> At least for Canadian crude, it's cheaper for oil producers to pay people to take oil off their hands in the short term, than it is to shut everything down and then restart it.
15:05 < jess> yeah
15:05 < jess> depends how long it goes on for
15:06 < hackintech> i mean i am okay with paying like 50 cents a gallon
15:13 < dgold> i think its fecking hillarious

15:16 < dgold> KeystoneXL needs oil prices above $150bbl to make any money, at all

16:49 < praetor> tee hee. I offered a termite snack to a spider friend and she took it
16:49 < audiodude> my spider friend got mad and bit my arm while I was sleeping
16:50 < praetor> aww
16:50 < audiodude> it swelled up huge, had to go to urgent care and get prednosone
16:50 < praetor> ouch. what bit you?
16:50 < audiodude> black widow
16:50 < audiodude> probably a male one
16:50 < praetor> amgry spider
16:51 < praetor> females are more venmous, so that's good-ish
16:51 < audiodude> I live in Northern CA it's black widow paradise
16:51 < audiodude> yeah
16:51 < audiodude> they are scary when you see them, they're like classic scary spider shaped
16:51 < praetor> my friends are orb weavers. they weave the most beautiful webs in the evenings. But I fed a termite to a wolf spider
16:52 < audiodude> we're friends with our spiders, in general, because we also have moths
16:52 < audiodude> and we do not like the moths
16:52  * praetor nods
16:52 < audiodude> spiders like them, for breakfast
16:53 < praetor> the orb weavers keep away the mosquitoes and crap so I can enjoy the balcony in the evenings

16:56 < Absalom> Hi, my coding project for the lockdown time was an IRC multiplayer hack'n slash game "Legend of the Pink Dragon" (a tribute to the old game "Legend of the Red Dragon"). It is hosted here on tilde.chat! See https://pink-dragon.surge.sh
16:56 < BitBot> [Title] Legend of the Pink Dragon
16:57 < jan6> huh, cool
16:57 < jan6> interesting to choose surge for hosting
16:57 < Absalom> Just released it; hope there aren't too many bugs.
16:57 < Absalom> Why?
16:57 < Absalom> I use surge as a quick HTML pastebin.
16:58 < jan6> interesting, as I don't think I've seen basically anyone use it ;P
16:58 < jan6> most people here would use a tilde instead, probably
16:58 < Absalom> Oh? I find it easy and quick for single HTML page, but didn't think much about it.
16:59 < jan6> sure
16:59 < jan6> the dragon's red not pink, to my eyes, but not too bad description
17:00 < jan6> would fit well with tilde.pink's theme, lol
17:00 < jan6> also typo in #legend's topig

19:20 <~khuxkm> but the point is that I'm not going to <somebody's SSN>.us.person
19:21 <~khuxkm> because that requires me to remember a whole bunch of numbers
19:21 <~khuxkm> and at that point I might as well just memorize the damn IP
19:21 <~khuxkm> I was specifically referring to login's "govs have solved that"; yes they have but not in a way that's conducive to dns
19:22 < login> everybody can add their nickname in front of their name
19:22 <~khuxkm> also what happens to your .person domain when you die
19:23 < login> nicknames are one worldwide
19:23 < login> khuxkm: nobody else gets that domain name ever again
19:23 <~khuxkm> ah, yes, "bigrobrobertmiles.us.person"
19:23 <~khuxkm> wow
19:23 < login> yeah
19:23 <~khuxkm> so if your name is really common, you just can't get a .person domain
19:23 <~khuxkm> and we're right back to where we f***ing started
19:23 < abirkill> just have a wiki-style disambiguation page, so john.smith.name just has links to all the different John Smiths, with their date of birth, official ID card photo, SSN, etc., and that links through to SSN.us.person ;)
19:23 < login> without adding a nice pseduonym to it
19:23 < death> and then there's me
19:23 < death> i use the name "ryan"
19:23 < login> there's also the fact
19:23 < terris> this idea is garbage
19:23 < death> don't use a last name
19:23 < login> does billgates get billgates.us.person?
19:23 <~khuxkm> abirkill: that might actually work
19:23 < login> which bill gatse?
19:23 < login> so there's an element of popularity
19:24 < death> i actually think the fact i don't use a last name makes it easier to identify me
19:24 < death> login: bill goatse
19:24 < login> abirkill: ssn.us.person -> ssn is private info
19:24 -!- max [~max@ip70-174-112-248.hr.hr.cox.net] has joined #meta

19:24 < cano> I'm gonna be first.us.person!
19:24 < lickthecheese> ssn--
19:24 < BitBot> [Karma] ssn now has -1 karma (-1 from lickthecheese)
19:24 <~khuxkm> it was never meant to be an authorization number
19:24 <~khuxkm> (ssn misuse)--
19:24 < BitBot> [Karma] ssn misuse now has -1 karma (-1 from khuxkm)
19:24 < login> but is is, khuxkm
19:25 < login> private key is so much better
19:25 < login> especially if used to derive new keys
19:25 <~khuxkm> also your name is very much usable to establish your identity
19:25 < login> per interaction
19:25 < death> actually what's funny now is i think the ID number on my driver's license is more appropriate than an SSN for identification
19:25 <~khuxkm> login: no, we're not doing fucking hidden services again
19:25 < login> which hidden services?
19:25 < jan6> lol
19:25 < jan6> yours
19:25 <~khuxkm> tor
19:25 <~khuxkm> onion routing
19:25 < jan6> i2p
19:25 <~khuxkm> those hidden services
19:25 < login> that's not connected

19:25 < death> ^
19:25 < login> other than that
19:25 < death> yeah
19:25 < jan6> ssh is key pairs
19:25 < death> like
19:25 < login> tor also uses it
19:25 < login> for hidden services
19:26 <~khuxkm> i'm not remembering:
19:26 < login> key pair -> hidden services
19:26 < death> pubkey authentication is probably the best way to do it, actually
19:26 < login> but hidden services -> key pair
19:26 < login> is not necessary
19:26 < death> just shove a Yubikey up your bum and use that
19:26 < lickthecheese> death: the us does not have a national identification id for each person, so the drivers license numbers can conflict
19:26 < login> yeah, the best part is
19:26 < login> you can shove it out if it gets stolen
19:26 < lickthecheese> lol (yubikey)++

19:26 < login> you dont' need ssn to live in the US
19:27 < login> it's just that you get no support from the state for anything
19:27 < jan6> dunno how they haven't figured out a nation-wide unique ID
19:27 < login> which is the same thing, but it circumvents the no nationwide ID law
19:27 < death> state doesn't give me support i don't give the state taxes
19:27 < death> get hecked, state
19:27 < death> lol
19:27 < login> through economic incenitive
19:27 < login> you don't have to pay taxes either
19:27 <~gbmor> jan6: it's not that nobody's figured it out it's that it's been defeated previously

19:40 < kumquat> I have a weird head for numbers. Doesn't get exercised much anymore since everyone's phone numbers are in our phones and you don't need to memorize them

19:41 < login> month of birth (two digits)

19:41 < jan6> jan != jan6, he's a different person who'll get pinged for no reason, lol
19:41 < login> that uniquely identifies almost everybody
19:41 < kumquat> I memorized 30 people's 3 extension numbers because I used them and memorizing is easier than looking for people's numbers  on a sheet
19:41 < demure> jan6: maybe you need a UUID
19:42 < jan6> totally not confusing having 2 jans here
19:42 <~khuxkm> I just like how my school handled their extensions
19:42 < jan6> login: just use the unix epoch time as identifying everyone's birth ;P
19:42 <~khuxkm> 4 digits: a building prefix, and the 3-digit room number
19:43 < kumquat> jan6 - change your nick :P
19:43 < jan6> lol no
19:43 < demure> *votes for jan6 nick change too*
19:43 <~khuxkm> so if you knew, say, the person you're trying to reach is in room 555 in the middle/high school, you would dial 4555

19:44 <~khuxkm> but yeah, I think the best bet would be to give a random hex number to identify a person
19:44 <~khuxkm> it's still 4/20 for me
19:44 < larvize> be too 
19:44 <~khuxkm> a global ID number
19:44 < login> don't we already have a global ID number?
19:44 <~khuxkm> no?
19:44 < login> it's
19:44 < login> <country name> <passport number>
19:45 < jan6> interesting nobody yelled out about 4/20 while I was in chat...
19:45 < login> global enough right?
19:45 < login> not everybody has a passport, but that can be arranged
19:45 < jan6> most people don't
19:45 <~khuxkm> ^
19:45 < login> then the solution is passport at birth
19:45 < login> ez
19:45 <~khuxkm> I only have a passport because I'm planning on going to costa rica my senior year
19:45 < jan6> unless you go to travel, there's not much need to get a passport

19:46 <~khuxkm> also they shouldn't expire

19:46 < login> there is a world passport
19:46 < login> khuxkm: that's also okay
19:46 <~khuxkm> no it's not you zipper
19:46 < login> they link your old number to your new one
19:46 < kumquat> well the reason passports expire is because there's a photo attached, and people can change a lot in the course of 10 years
19:46 < login> in their databases
19:46 < jan6> khuxkm: no expiring = someone will try to use their passport from 50 years ago that's half-decomposed and sat on and has coffee stains, lol, also yes, photo...
19:46 <~gbmor> charging for identification is absurd because the result is a lot of poor people in the US don't have photo ID, and that is then used to disenfranchise them because some voting districts require photo ID
19:46 < kumquat> French driver's licenses stay good for 30 years, which is insane to me.

19:48 < login> well, that length of hair is on the extreme side
19:48 < kumquat> god I forgot about the moustache
19:48 <~gbmor> i was i think 24 in my current license photo, it's valid until my 35th birthday, and in my photo i'm not wearing glasses and my hair is long so people look at it really carefully when they need to see it

19:49 < kumquat> whenever I have to get photos taken for ID or whatever, mspe has to come with me to help

19:49 < jan6> not neccessarily, lol, login, have you heard of water?
19:49 <~khuxkm> it's soaked in water
19:49 < demure> what logic?
19:49 < kumquat> because you're not allowed to wear glasses and I can't see shit without mine
19:49 < june> gbmor: everyone gets ID here, and I don't even think you're allowed to require ID to vote

19:54 < mspe> login: lots of brushing, most of the time tangled; outside in ponytail, inside headbands
19:54 <~khuxkm> login i swear to god
19:54 < login> each one is unique in the whole wide universe
19:54 <~khuxkm> we're not doing private key shit because onion services already do that
19:54 <~khuxkm> and it's a pain in the ass
19:54 < login> Why? What can I do to not irritate you khuxkm?
19:54 < jan6> shut up you wet blanket ;P
19:54 <~khuxkm> ^
19:54 < lickthecheese> lol
19:54 < demure> ask less inane questions
19:54 <~khuxkm> ^
19:54 < demure> self filtering inane questions would go a long way
19:55 < jan6> insane questions AND answers ;P
19:55 <~khuxkm> i've already brought up that onion services (which do exactly as you describe) result in unwieldy URLs
19:55 < jan6> answers is the most annoying part
19:55 <~khuxkm> at least I can remember 5e400a6423c.person
19:55 <~khuxkm> that's not hard to remember
19:55 < jan6> depends on onion
19:55 < jan6> the old ones don't
19:55 < kumquat> onions are tasty
19:55 < lickthecheese> i remember my my onion service 
19:55 <~khuxkm> unlike adef2410a1fq14g5g1i1r0g1rgo1lenvo1rhv183rvn.onion
19:56 < jan6> onions are like ogres
19:56 <~khuxkm> they have layers
19:56 <~khuxkm> ?
19:56 < lickthecheese> ltcpiz23dznrv62p.onion
19:56 < jan6> and they're green
19:56 < kumquat> not all of them are green
19:56 < lickthecheese> (it doesint go anywhere since i didint bother to fix it last time it broke)
19:56 < jan6> they are when they're growing, and not a special breed
19:56 < kumquat> or at least they shouldn't be unless you're letting them all go moldy
19:56 < jan6> both above, and underground's topmost layers
19:57 <~khuxkm> jan6: you're thinking of scallions
19:57 < kumquat> I mean yes onion tops are green
19:57 < lickthecheese> lmao
19:57 < kumquat> but white and yellow onions are def. not green
19:57 < kumquat> nor are red onions, obviously
19:57 < lickthecheese> manilla onions?
19:58 < kumquat> do you mean vidalia?
19:58 < jan6> what about blue onions, then
19:58 <~gbmor> scallions are just boneless onions
19:58 < kumquat> no such thing so far as I'm aware
19:58 < terris> l
19:58 < lickthecheese> wait arent scalions fish lmao

19:58 <~gbmor> that's scallops
19:58 < kumquat> lol gbmor
19:58 < lickthecheese> oh
19:58 < login> have you heard of the theorem
19:58 < kumquat> apparently scallions aren't universal
19:58 < login> where human-centric names
19:59 <~gbmor> they're mollusks tho
19:59 < login> are impossible if you have two other properties
19:59 < kumquat> French people looked at me like I was nuts when I bought young onions and used the green onion tops
19:59 < kumquat> like, "wtf are you doing, throw that out"
19:59 < lickthecheese> gbmor: you and b e n should share a irc bouncer so you can both use the nick b e n
19:59 <~gbmor> no lickthecheese 
19:59 < lickthecheese> lmao
19:59 <~khuxkm> that's not a good idea owen
19:59 < demure> *flop*
20:00 < kumquat> that seems needlessly confusing
20:00 < jan6> lol
20:00 < kumquat> for ben and gbmor to use the same nick
20:00 < jan6> MOAR confustion!
20:00 <~gbmor> yes i agree it's confusing

20:02 < jan6> sand witch
20:02 < demure> it's a particularly good brand of sauce too 
20:02 < kumquat> I made mushroom and sundried tomato risotto
20:02 <~khuxkm> also can we talk about how python 3.5 doesn't have random.choices
20:02 < hackintech> wat
20:02 <~khuxkm> and how dumb that is
20:02 < hackintech> it doesn't
20:02 < jan6> lolwut
20:02 <~khuxkm> ,py sys.version
20:02 < BitBot> [Python] khuxkm: 3.5.2 (default, Jun 28 2016, 18:49:03) 
20:02 < jan6> at least 3.6 has...right...right?
20:02 <~khuxkm> ,py import random; random.choices
20:02 < BitBot> [Python] khuxkm: AttributeError: module 'random' has no attribute 'choices'
20:03 < hackintech> what
20:03 <~khuxkm> jan6: it was introduced in 3.6, yes
20:03 < demure> why are you on python 3.5? I have 3.8.2 here
20:03 < jan6> bitbot is
20:03 < anelki> it's bitbot's version 
20:04 < jan6> and bitbot abuses an API somewhere, lol
20:04 < jan6> I think it was w3schools's API
20:04 <~khuxkm> it's a heroku app specifically
20:04 <~khuxkm> it used to use tutorialspoint's api
20:04 < jan6> ah right, that
20:04 <~khuxkm> but it changed over to this new app
20:04 <~khuxkm> that's running on outdated Python
20:04 < jan6> lol why
20:04 <~khuxkm> idk
20:04 < jan6> new app, old python...
20:04 < jan6> doesn't make sense
20:05 <~khuxkm> because the person running it hasn't updated their procfile
20:05 < demure> maybe there are running it in an old out of date ubuntu docker, that they are not maintaining XD
20:05 < jan6> new app means they don't have to deal with "but it only works with this specific version", lol
20:05 < jan6> lol probably
20:05 < jan6> ,py os.exec(uname -a)
20:05 < BitBot> [Python] jan6: AttributeError: module 'os' has no attribute 'exec'
