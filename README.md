# txtfiles

Just a bunch of random text files from my homedir on tilde.team. As part of my attempt at using less space sometime(tm), I'm putting them here. Some of them are useful if you want to run some of the scripts in [pyfiles][], others are just random irc logs. Don't hunt down the people in my logs or make fun of them. The files needed for scripts in pyfiles are licensed under MIT, and the logs are available for use provided that you don't harass anybody who appears in them.
