16:54 < adam> eop: what image did you share?

16:54 < BitBot> [Tweets] (@Devon_OnEarth, 1w 9d ago) Its difficult to prove to my students that evolution is an ongoing process of continual adaptation to environmental change, not a linear process from 'worse animal' to 'better animal'  The way I prove it is by showing them nature's early forays into Elephants, which were better https://t.co/76kzch4Oet
16:54 < june> also if you're not going to open an image I think it's rude to ask what it is
16:55 < anelki> later y'all
16:55 < anton> june: after gbmor said "what the fuck" I didn't want to click on it... does that not make sense?
16:55 < eop> Good luck with the call anelki!
16:55 < anton> good luck anelki
16:55 < adam> good luck anelki
16:55 < june> it makes sense but you don't need to ask twice about it

16:56 < eop> Adton
