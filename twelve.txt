09:45 < Dr-WaSabi> mspe: cool. thanks
09:45 < mspe> because it's in Mercator projection
09:47 < mspe> this projection distorts exponentially towards the poles
09:48 < mspe> and the more you zoom out, the wronger the map gets
09:48 < mspe> cause it gets more different levels of distortion
09:48 < xfnw> why dont they use a sphere like google maps does
09:49 < mspe> google also uses the mercator projection for the thumbnails
09:49 < mspe> they just reproject the distorted thumbnails back on a 3D sphere

09:56 < kumquat> it's two people and they just go to this one market that's open all week long, but only on Sundays
09:56 < xfnw> :( i tried using a cd as a brake disk, but then it snapped
09:56 <~ben> i should walk over to potters
09:56 < Dr-WaSabi> potters
09:57 < kumquat> I could make donuts myself but I hate deep frying stuff
09:57 <~ben> potters has some dang good donuts
09:58 < kumquat> the smell takes forever to leave and then you have like 2 liters of oil that you end up putting in a jar and forgetting about
09:58 < Dr-WaSabi> potters rocks
09:58 <~ben> yeah i wouldn't want to deep fry at home
09:59 < Dr-WaSabi> yeah, thats why we only did it when camping.. a dutch oven, bunch of oil, and grands biskit dough.  and a pop bottle cap to make the hole in the center
10:00 < kumquat> makes sense
10:01 < thefunkyspaw> I'm using quassel, with quassel-client on my devices and quassel-core on my server. Unfortunately, the quassel-client is built in qt and for some reason qt doesn't want to respect my font-prefers settings. This means that emoji like 😄 come from my base font package and not emoji one font package.

10:11 <~ben> worth a try
10:11 <~ben> janne is usually quick
10:12 < thefunkyspaw> OK. I'll need to gather my documentation on the whole qt / xfce issue. I have to make the case that, even though XFCE and QT should work together to fix this, they won't.
10:12 <~ben> i'd still recommend trying biboumi :)
10:12 < thefunkyspaw> I will :)
10:13 < thefunkyspaw> I could get back into old-school ascii faces. I'm using em-py to pick emoji, so I can add anything I want by just modifying a json file.

10:22 < jayden> it automatically makes windows tile
10:23 <~benharri> I tried it once but it didn't seem that useful for me
10:23 < jayden> Basically i3wm tiling for gnome

10:29 < thefunkyspaw> ~benharri | I've been thinking of setting up my own server. Just a matter of whether it's worth the time or not.
10:29 <~benharri> it's not that bad
10:29 < jayden> thefunkyspaw: make sure you get quad core intel core i7s in your serve
10:29 < jayden> server
10:29 <~benharri> why would you put consumer hardware in a server?
10:29 < jayden> its not why its why not
10:29 < xfnw> lol
10:29 <~benharri> because i'd rather have a server cpu
10:30 < thefunkyspaw> sum7 seems to be pretty reliable, but if I make a lot of friends I'll have to worry about account longevity
10:30  * xfnw takes ben's six tilde.team cores away
10:30 <~benharri> ya that's why i moved to my own
10:30 <~benharri> took me a couple hours to set it up the first time
10:30 <~benharri> once i learned all the srv records etc
10:30 <~benharri> holler if you have questions
10:30 < jayden> Guys
10:30 < jayden> how do I get my private key to work with ssh
10:30 < thefunkyspaw> ~benharri | will do!
10:31 < thefunkyspaw> jayden | do you have a private key yet?
10:31 <~benharri> now i'm trying to remember what cpu my dedi has
10:31 < jayden> apparently when I transferend my private key to a new install of fedora the modes on my private key reset
10:31 <~benharri> fix the permissions then
10:31 < jayden> what perms to add
10:31 <~benharri> 600
10:31 < thefunkyspaw> sudo chmod 600 for the file with no extension
10:31 < jayden> k thx
10:31 <~benharri> no need for sudo
10:31 <~benharri> it's meant to be owned by the same user

10:33  * hackintech claps loudly
10:33 < thefunkyspaw> For a home user, a laptop is basically the perfect server
10:34 <~benharri> ya i put proxmox on there
10:34 < thefunkyspaw> lower power usage, minimal space, integrated screen and keyboard
10:34 < thefunkyspaw> the only downside is a shortage of sata ports
10:34 <~benharri> i added ram and swapped in an ssd

10:35 <~benharri> four 10tb hdds and a 1tb ssd in there
10:35 <~benharri> why rsync instead of raid?
10:35 < thefunkyspaw> I knew rsync, and I don't know raid :-)
10:36 < jan6> lol
10:37 < thefunkyspaw> I have to pick and choose what I learn, not enough time for everything :-)
10:37 < jan6> y'all with money to buy space
10:37 < jan6> lol
10:37 < microwave> Hello
10:37 < jan6> olleh
10:37 < thefunkyspaw> hi microwave!
10:38 < thefunkyspaw> we were just sharing our home-server setups. Do you have one?
10:38 < microwave> Ye
10:38 < jan6> for once a word that is NOT xfnw's nick
10:38 < jan6> lol
10:38 < microwave> I am currently working on my own pubnix
10:38 <~ben> nice
10:38 < anton> nice
10:38 < microwave> and I have a personal server, that's it
10:38 < jan6> great
10:39 <~ben> i bought all external drives and shucked them
10:39 <~ben> cheaper for some reason
10:39 < thefunkyspaw> Its cheaper because they buy bulk lots of white-label drives
10:39 < jan6> btw did you know there's a way to have ssh keys basically signed by a CA, and as such you don't need to individually add keys, only make sure they're signed with a CA the server trusts?
10:39 < thefunkyspaw> I did not, that sounds useful
10:39 < xfnw> lolol shucked them
10:39 < jan6> yeah
10:39 < thefunkyspaw> What happens if the CA unsigns your key?
10:39 <~ben> then it's no longer valid?
10:39 < jan6> it's untrusted, duh
10:40 <~ben> ahh yeah 
10:40 < thefunkyspaw> It sounds like that gives an awful lot of power to the CA
10:40 < jan6> I think you CAN still add keys manually too
10:40 < thefunkyspaw> Does the CA have the ability to track your authentications? For example, would your CA have a list of every server you authed with and when?
10:41 < jan6> why would they?
10:41 < thefunkyspaw> I'm convinced big tech companies are using CA activity to predict the growth of other tech companies and play the market, or predict their moves and out maneuver them.
10:42 < jan6> lol
10:42 < jan6> you'd need to somehow get that data
10:42 <~ben> wouldn't be surprised tbh
10:42 < thefunkyspaw> At scale, a company could use CA data to predict competitive growth. For example, if Lowes gets more auths than Home Depot, then Lowes is growing relative to home depot
10:42 < jan6> and I don't see how the CA could track anything, anyway
10:43 < thefunkyspaw> I work in the satellite field, and a company called "black sky" took pictures of Lowes and Home Depot parking lots, used AI to count the cars, and they sold that data to a third party. Real thing that happened.
10:43 < jan6> lol
10:43 < thefunkyspaw> If private investors will go to *that* length for that kind of data, using CA authorities to track user movement is well within the realm of the reasonable
10:44 < jan6> that kind of stuff is kinda obviously gonna happen till the laws reach the space stuff
10:44 < jan6> but you won't get the images of that specific car part that often unless you specifically set a flight path to do so

10:49 < jan6> apparently you MUST be your own CA
10:49 < jan6> lol
10:49 < jan6> To generate a key pair for a CA, you’d do it the usual way you generate a regular SSH key pair:
10:49 < jan6> ssh-keygen -f my_ca
10:49 <~benharri> i had an extra biboumi connection
10:49 < thefunkyspaw> Is it possible to use letsencrypt as a CA for your ssh key?
10:49 < ace> ok, thanks jan6 and axfnw, my issue was that i was using the wrong username (ace@tilde.team, instead of just "ace"), its working now!
10:49 <~benharri> unlikely
10:50 < jan6> as they say, the CA is just another ssh keypair
10:50 < thefunkyspaw> I should read up on CAs again
10:50 <~benharri> ace: ah yeah it's just username with no domain
10:50 < jan6> you can probably import a normal RSA key into a RSA ssh key, with some trickery tho
10:50 < jan6> just like you can sign data with ssh keys
10:50 < jan6> but only a little bit of data, and only with rsa keys, afaik
10:51 < xfnw> signify can sign data with ed25519 keys
10:51 < jan6> (but that's a legit strat that's shown online, you use symmetric encryption, and encrypt that key with ssh key, and boom)
10:51 < jan6> xfnw: that's besides the point, lol
10:51 < thefunkyspaw> here I was using GPG like an old-timer
10:51 < jan6> minisign can too
10:51 < thefunkyspaw> (anything that replaces gpg is worth considering)
10:51 < xfnw> jan6: > and only with rsa keys
10:51 < jan6> ssh signing is useful if you have the person's ssh key, and wanna send secrets, but don't wanna have to ask for gpg key or some other info
10:52 < thefunkyspaw> yes, also its probably less convoluted from a user perspective, lol
10:52 < jan6> the trick I saw used openssl rsautil, and I looked, there doesn't seem to be an equivalent to rsautil for ec or stuff ;P
10:52 < jan6> most useful way I see the ssh signing is like with tildes ;P
10:53 < jan6> you can automatically sign data sent to each user, because you already know their keys
10:53 < jan6> or I think envs had public ssh pubkeys for each user too with an APi
10:53 < thefunkyspaw> that's a good point
10:53 < jan6> in which case you can use that too
10:53 < thefunkyspaw> and having a single pubkey for all users is really convenient
10:54 < jan6> it's secure, but annoying to use as a normal encryption way, but it's great if you already have the person's key and don't wanna bother them more, especially if they don't yet use gpg or stuff
10:54 < ace> https://github.com/torvalds.keys <- you can find keys on github
10:54 < jan6> too bad it works only on rsa, lol
10:55 < jan6> well, the openssl rsautil way is the only way I know of using the ssh keys to encrypt stuff, buuut you can turn a ed25519 key into a x25519 key, iirc, for what it's worth...
10:55 < jan6> so that one might work for those keys
10:55 < jan6> idk
10:56 < jan6> I just found it today, and found it cool and interesting
10:56 < jan6> lol
10:56 < thefunkyspaw> it is really cool
10:56 < jan6> also I found a gpg vanity key generator
10:56 < jan6> that is also really cool
10:56 < ace> ed25519 is for signing, and x25519 for asymetric encryption?
10:56 < jan6> I got an ultra cool key with that
10:56 < thefunkyspaw> if this were XMPP, you could show us ;-)
10:56 < thefunkyspaw> 🔥
10:56 < tildebot> [Demojize] <thefunkyspaw> :fire:
10:57 < ace> you can create "two" x25519 keypairs from one ed25519 keypair, right?
10:57 < jan6> other way around, iirc
10:57 < jan6> one ed25519 is one of the two possible ones for an x25519, I think
10:58 < jan6> idk
10:58 < jan6> but cool stuff
10:58 < ace> yeah, something about a single bit flip for the "twin-pair" of keys
10:59 < jan6> yes, creme's users_info.json allows uploading several ssh pubkeys to the API, that's nice
10:59 < jan6> yeah, positive and negative variants of a single key
10:59  * jan6 off, btw

12:01 <~ben> idk i just really like bass
12:01 < kirch> BUT - people want to be in a band, and bands need drums & bass

12:02  * kumquat blasts jan6 blasting cranberries
12:02 < kernel_pancake> -s
12:02  * jan6 always gets real sad remembering cranberries is over... and it's literally the only thing that can consistently do that... or even inconsistently, for more than twice...
12:03 < kirch> I'm trying to learn piano, too... like, I can do melodies, but I don't really know what chords are what without counting intervals
12:03 < kumquat> but the music will always live on
12:03 < dgy> i play the kazoo. and the mouth harp, but that's one hard
12:03 < kirch> jan6: did you see Miley Cirus singing Zombie?
12:03 < jan6> who tf cares about music theory, just play what feels nice!
12:03 < jan6> zombie is so overplayed I can't stand it, lol
12:03 < kirch> dgy: like the Snoopy jaw harp?
12:03 < kumquat> lol jan6
12:03 < kirch> I have a snoopy jaw harp... it's fun
12:03 < jan6> as in, it's like literally the ONLY song of cranberries people seem to EVER cover
12:03 < dgy> kirch: yes. actually it even has snoopy on the box
12:04 < kumquat> music theory is interesting, though
12:04 < jan6> theory is interesting
12:04 < jan6> rules are not
12:04 < jan6> applies to most things, not only music
12:04 < kumquat> baby kumquat wanted to get a phd in music theory
12:04 < kumquat> then life happened
12:04 < jan6> baby jan6 wanted to be an inventor, then existance happened
12:04 < kirch> jan6: it's either that or Linger.... but Zombie's more political ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

12:05 < kirch> I should've bit the bullet and joined all the HS bands to get into that music theory class.... but like, you couldn't be in one band in HS, you had to be in all of them - and I played bass back then and couldn't conceive of playing bass in a marching band.
12:05 < jan6> why couldn't you be in just one, lol
12:05 < dgy> you kinda need some music theory if you wanna use stuff like trackers and all. hard to just "play what you like" on those
12:05 < kirch> jan6: school rules ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
12:05 < kernel_pancake> kirch: do you self-teach the piano?
12:05 < jan6> stupid school
12:06 < jan6> (kirch's high school)--
12:06 < tildebot> [Karma] kirch's high school now has -1 karma (-1 from jan6)
12:06 < kumquat> kirch: really?
12:06 < kirch> kernel_pancake: yeah, I'm completely self-taught... which is weird coz my dad & step-mom are BOTH professional musicians...
12:06 < ace> or a harmonica, those arent too hard play a tune on

12:08 < kirch> when I worked at Radio Shack I played with one of those Casio keyboards where the notes would light up for you to play
12:08 < kernel_pancake> cool
12:08 < kirch> it helped a little, but I never had enough time to truly study what I was doing
12:08 -!- wingy [wingy@tilde.town] has joined #team

12:09 < kirch> I remember I had a cakewalk midi keyboard and this kids game where a note would fall from the top and you'd have to play it before it went off the bottom.... really dumb game... I still can't read sheet music
12:09 < jan6> the dude was "too lazy" to do standard music notation
12:09 < jan6> lol
12:09 < jan6> I love the music and the lil ol flash game
12:09 < jmw\0> How come everyone else's first i3wm setup is sooo cool and transparent while  mine has default i3blocks  and i3bar and a cool background
12:09 < kernel_pancake> maybe sheet music is overrated
12:09 < kirch> you only really need to know music notation to share music on paper
12:09 < jan6> https://www.kongregate.com/games/innomin/fear-less is one place to play the flash game, if you care

12:10 < jan6> sheet music in standard notation IS overrated
12:10 < jan6> but it's useful universal medium
12:10 < jan6> your sheet music will always "just work" as long as it's not black midi or some other insanity
12:10 < jan6> lol

12:11 < dgy> also black midi is great
12:11 < jan6> it's not a linux community, that's the secret, jmw\0 
12:11 < kernel_pancake> jmw\0: I think you have to blame ben
12:11 < kirch> like, with folk music you'd teach other people and learn from one another instead of having sheet music - so your lyrics might be a little off from theirs, but it was still the same song
12:11 < jan6> it's an everything community
12:11 < jmw\0> Fresh baked corn kernels
12:11 < dgy> you keep changing nicks, my ignore list hungers
12:11 < jmw\0> these corn kernels are fresh and version 5.8.10
12:12 < jan6> get a better ignore function
12:12 < jan6> lol
12:12 < jan6> or better yet, just filter
12:12 < kirch> in Celtic music they have this tradition of "Kitchen Parties" - where like, you just sit around with a musician or two and dance and whatnot
12:12 < dgy> or just start ignoring masks instead of nicks haha. but i'm lazy
12:12 < jmw\0> I just like having funny nicks ok
12:12 < jan6> get one that blocks based on the username, not nickname, or at least that tracks the nick changes ;P

14:25 < Dr-WaSabi> and yes.  vim configs can be for some people

16:20 <~ben> watch (rewatch?) avatar the last airbender
16:23 < thefunkyspaw> continuum is a dystopian sci-fi cop show about time travelers from a corporate controlled future messing up the present
16:24 < thefunkyspaw> Its good, but not as good as travelers
16:25 < kirch> Danger 5...
16:25 < kirch> Serial Expiriment Lain...
16:26 < kirch> The Rockford Files...
16:26 < Dr-WaSabi> and now I've got Mike Posts Rockford files theme playing in my heads
16:27 < kirch> Gravity Falls...
16:27 < kirch> Sailor Moon...
16:28 < michel> I miss Serial Experiment Lain, I wish it's available for streaming (can't locate my DVDs)
16:28 < Dr-WaSabi> TeraNova I liked
16:29 < Dr-WaSabi> and then there is just Firefly. I can always rewatch that
16:30 <~ben> firefly is wonderful
16:31 < thefunkyspaw> 🏴‍☠️michel🏴‍☠️
16:31 < tildebot> [Demojize] <thefunkyspaw> :pirate_flag:michel:pirate_flag:
16:31 < kirch> I haven't seen Firefly/Serenity yet.... I want to - but I found out it was on netflix when they accounced they removed it from netflix
16:32 <~ben> i have it downlaoded
16:32 < kumquat> the movie is kinda meh, as all movies tend to be
16:33 <~ben> ya
16:34 < kirch> Well... I figure it's like Farscape - where it got canned and they made a movie to tie up loose ends and only managed half of them
16:36 <~ben> pretty juch
16:36 < Dr-WaSabi> I got to see serenity 3 times in the theater... I'm a bit of browncoat
16:36 < thefunkyspaw> I love farscape, but the last two seasons went off the rails
16:36 <~ben> lol nice
16:36 < thefunkyspaw> Dr-Wasabi very cool
16:37 < Dr-WaSabi> farscape got weird there for a while.  but it was very cool to see the cast transition over SG1 so well
16:37 < thefunkyspaw> I never watched through star-gate
16:37 < thefunkyspaw> I probably should, I think I'd like it
16:38 < thefunkyspaw> Have ya'll seen Andromeda? 
16:39 < Dr-WaSabi> I saw the movie with Kirt Russell in the theaters back in the late 80s I think it was.  I have most of SG1, SGA, and SGU on dvd, and BR
16:39 < thefunkyspaw> nice
16:40 < ace> thefunkyspaw, Continuum looks cool
16:40 < Dr-WaSabi> also have most of the remake of Battle Star.. but then in the last few seasons I lost interest, or thought it got weird
16:40 < ace> ben, firely is awesome
16:40 <~ben> sure is
16:40 < thefunkyspaw> Continuum is pretty good. Not amazing, but good. I watched it because I wasn't ready for travelers to be over, lol
16:41 < Dr-WaSabi> 'I can kill you with my mind'
16:41 < thefunkyspaw> The remake of battlestar was great until the writer's strike
16:41 < xfnw> i can kill you with `murder crewmate`
16:42 < Dr-WaSabi> oh I forgot about that
16:42 < Dr-WaSabi> yeah that sounds about right
16:42 < thefunkyspaw> Oh, I forgot to share the pitch for andromeda. Its like star trek (it even has gene roddenbury), but the captain is kevin sorbo and its all about federalism
16:42 < Dr-WaSabi> Oh I had forgot about that one
16:43 < kirch> I started watching Lexx - and decided to leave it in my nostalgia intact because it wasn't as neat as I rememeber
16:43 < ace> im currently watching original Dragon Ball: https://nyaa.si/view/1259391
16:43 < tildebot> [Title] Dragon Ball Recut (Complete) WITH BROADCAST AUDIO (ドラゴンボール 再編集) :: Nyaa
16:44 < Dr-WaSabi> thefunkyspaw: andromeda I liked, I just felt bad for how long it must of taken some of the cast to get into makeup each morning, and still get paid way less then Kenvin Sorbo
16:44 < thefunkyspaw> haha, true
16:45 < Dr-WaSabi> I really liked the idea of living space craft
16:45 < thefunkyspaw> It also suffered from the same "fizzle and die" that the other scifi shows of that era suffered from
16:45 < thefunkyspaw> Both Farscape and Andromeda did
16:45 < Dr-WaSabi> yup
16:45 < thefunkyspaw> And babylon 5
16:45 < Dr-WaSabi> never could get into that show
16:46 < thefunkyspaw> It... had a bad rhythm
16:46 < thefunkyspaw> The first season was basically a different show. They literally swapped the cast out.
16:47 < thefunkyspaw> Seasons 2-X were a geopolitical power struggle with terrorists and a monster-of-the-week
16:47 < Dr-WaSabi> I also could never get into ST Deepspace 9
16:47 < Dr-WaSabi> loved TNG, Voyager, and Enterprise.. just didn't like DS9
16:49 < thefunkyspaw> Kind of a change of pace: how do people feel about Buffy the Vampire Slayer

16:53 < Dr-WaSabi> again.  bit of a Joss Wedon fan
16:53 < thefunkyspaw> I discovered it in college, streamed it. Later I got married and bought the collectors edition so my wife would have to watch it too, lol
16:54 < Dr-WaSabi> also used to like Charmed, at first.. but then go weird later on
16:57 < thefunkyspaw> I tried to re-watch charmed, but didn't get very far
16:57 < thefunkyspaw> I heard they did a remake
16:57 < thefunkyspaw> wonder if its better
17:02 < Dr-WaSabi> no clue

17:09 < jayden> someone please help me
17:09 < kirch> like, a shell?
17:09 < jayden> no
17:09 < jayden> just a blinking thing
17:09 < Dr-WaSabi> do you see all the start up messages before that?

17:12 < jayden> Dr-WaSabi: im on a laptop
17:12 < thefunkyspaw> what hapoens when you type "startx"
17:12 < jayden> Some errors thrown at me
17:12 < jayden> i tried the startx command it didnt work out
17:12 < kirch> jayden: did it work before?
17:12 < jayden> kirch: yeah
17:12 < thefunkyspaw> The errors are probably the key to figuring out what went wrong
17:12 < jayden> kirch: 30 minutes ago
17:13 < jayden> since i cant get into gnome-shell I cant copy and paste
17:13 < jayden> uGh
17:13 < jayden> maybe i can write the logs to a file and upload it to ttm.sh

17:34 < blitzkraft_> Did you try hitting ctrl-alt-f7
17:34 < jayden> tf?
17:34 < blitzkraft_> Or alt-f7
17:35 < jayden> how would that help
17:35 < thefunkyspaw> it switches to tty7
17:35 < thefunkyspaw> thats where x should have started
17:35 < jayden> i have plenty of ttys already
17:35 < blitzkraft_> Yes, and that's where default x sessions start

17:36 < thefunkyspaw> honestly, when you're learning linux you are likely to have to reinstall a bunch of times
17:36 < thefunkyspaw> just goes with the territory
17:36 < jayden> ctrl + alt + FN + f7 doesnt go to tty7
17:36 < jayden> i have to press the FN key btw
17:36 < jayden> But there is no luck tty7 isnt a thing in fedora
17:36 < jayden> thefunkyspaw: i literally didnt do anything  to any files
17:36 < blitzkraft_> lol. You're wrong
17:37 < blitzkraft_> There is a tty7.
17:37 < jayden> ctrl alt f7 doesn't bring up a tty
17:37 < blitzkraft_> what happens when you hit that?
17:38 < jayden> nothing
17:38 < jayden> im mistaken
17:38 < jayden> it brings me to a blinking light
17:38 < xfnw> what about ctrl alt f3

17:40 < jayden> delete them and have them regenerate?

17:55 < xfnw> wtf that one goes to a porn site
17:56 < xfnw> oh you forgot the .txt
17:56 < xfnw> https://ttm.sh/hH5.txt
17:56 < cdmnky> oh my god
17:56 < dgy> report it
17:57 < xfnw> report it to whom?
17:57 < dgy> to ben?
17:57 < cdmnky> that seems like an extreme edge case for the URL shortlinker, leave off the file extension and it points to something completely different rather than the file
17:58 < cdmnky> and in this case it happened to be something... uh....
18:01 < blitzkraft_> Wtf
18:02  * cdmnky wonders if there should be some further differentiation between shortlinks and files to make sure something like this can't happen
18:04 < dgy> i imagine that it points to some porn because someone made it to. shortened links don't just happen
18:04 < dgy> also that kid needs to be out of here, but that's just an opinion
18:05 < cdmnky> well yeah, i'm saying that it was probably done by someone else and it was just miscopying the link
18:05 < cdmnky> it seems like a really easy thing to do on accident, just this time it happened to go to someone else's shortlink
18:06 < dgy> i don't believe in coincidences, tbh. but still, the link should be reported
18:06 < xfnw> dgy: ttmsh does not allow vanity links, it would be pretty hard to do that on purpose
18:07 < dgy> yeah, i figured. it's just the paranoia in me
18:07 < blitzkraft_> I think the file share links and url links are in a separate sequenc.

21:02 < rndusr> I use arch linux btw

21:03 < rndusr> bruh
21:03 < jayden> am i allowed to have my bot join here

21:05 < jayden> hmm
21:05 < rndusr> your harddrive is too small
21:05 < jayden> rndusr: was a big virtual hard disk in the VM
21:06 < rndusr> was it r/o
21:06 < jayden> vmware workstation pro
21:06 < jayden> was my virtual machine tool
21:06 < rndusr> jayden: was it r/o
21:06 < jayden> rndusr: im never using arch so it doesnt matter
21:07 < jayden> arch is a flex
21:07 < rndusr> it is superior
21:07 < rndusr> it's not just a flex
21:07 < jayden> and hard
21:08 < jayden> Why take hours to install arch when you could take a few minutes to write an iso to a usb boot off and run a GUI installer
21:08 < jayden> Artix has few differences from arch
21:08 < rndusr> but artix on the desktop is inefficent
21:08 < jayden> pff
21:09 < rndusr> ?
21:09 < jayden> runs fine with i3wm and gnoem
21:09 < jayden> gnome
21:09 < jayden> and the like
21:09 < rndusr> but it wastes ram
21:09 < jayden> pff
21:09 < rndusr> and cpu cycles
21:09 < jayden> rndusr: imagine not having 12gigs of ram in a PC tower
21:09 < jayden> L M A O

21:10 < rndusr> jayden: I don't use a de, but I use sowm with st, dmenu, and vimb
21:10 < jayden> why not i3wm
21:10 < rndusr> jayden: i3wm uses xlib
21:10 < jayden> so?
21:11 < rndusr> all my other programs use the other x library that I forgot the name of
21:11 < jayden> i3wm is my preferred window manager
21:11 < rndusr> cool
21:11 < jayden> cuz it works just works
21:11 < jayden> just works out of the box\
21:11 < rndusr> I also use sowm because it has no configuration files
21:11 < rndusr> so it runs faster
21:12 < jayden> bad hardwrae
21:12 < jayden> hardware
21:12 < rndusr> me?
21:12 < rndusr> because if so, yes
21:12 < jayden> specs?

21:13 < jayden> CPU?
21:13 < jayden> RAM?
21:13 < rndusr> 2 gb of ram
21:13 < jayden> WTF?
21:13 < rndusr> ~intel celeron
21:13 < jayden> 4GB IS CHEAP
21:13 < jayden> AN INTEL CORE i3 IS CHEA
21:13 < jayden> CHEAP
21:13 < rndusr> jayden: but an intel celeron and 2 gb of ram is free ;)
21:14 < jayden> get better specs 
21:14 < jayden> please
21:14 < jayden> ditch the celeron
21:14 < rndusr> but why
21:14 < xfnw> jayden: no u, i like my celeron
21:14 < rndusr> this works just fine
21:14 < jayden> let me guess you have a 50gb 4000 RPM hard disk
21:14 < rndusr> jayden: no
21:14 < jayden> rndusr: thats an insanely bad computer mate

22:18 < tildebot> [Ducks] rndusr befriended a duck in 1.76 seconds! You've befriended 4 ducks in #team!
22:18 < tildebot> [Ducks] khuxkm: There was no duck! missed by 0.08 seconds
22:18 < tomasino> use printf, avoid echo
22:18 <@khuxkm> hyperreal: both you and rndusr made the same mistake
22:18 < hyperreal> ^
22:19 < rndusr> huh?
22:19 < rndusr> oh
22:19 < rndusr> use %s for strings
22:19 < hyperreal> khuxkm: what?
22:19 <@khuxkm> a) there's a sleep between the messages and b) you're missing the newlines between the echo commands
22:19 <@khuxkm> mine is, afaict, completely accurate
22:20 < rndusr> is there *really* a need for sleep
22:20 < jayden> any echo syntax that can have commands and text in one echo line
22:20 < rndusr> jayden: how?
22:20 <@khuxkm> rndusr: it's in the command we're shortening and therefore it needs to be in the shortened command
22:20 < rndusr> right
22:20 <@khuxkm> I just confirmed, my version produces the exact same output as the original
22:21 < jayden> and its longer than what i gave you guys
22:21 < jayden> khuxkm: lmao
22:21 <@khuxkm> but that's because you put a sleep in there for no reason
22:21 <@khuxkm> without the sleep mine would be shorter than yours
22:21 < jayden> its so it doesn't give out all the text in one go
22:21 <@khuxkm> also this isn't even a useful command in the first place
22:21 < hyperreal> ^
22:22 <@khuxkm> yeah but why not just put all the text out at once
22:22 < jayden> khuxkm: this is talking diolauge
22:22 < jayden> TALKING DIOLAUGE
22:22 <@khuxkm> why are you writing dialogue
22:22 <@khuxkm> in a shell script
22:22 < jayden> its part of the game 
22:22 <@khuxkm> using echo
22:22 <@khuxkm> use printf you small child
22:22 <@khuxkm> it's a POSIX binary so if your system doesn't have it then your system is Bad
22:22 < jayden> echo is easier for me to use
22:22 <@khuxkm> too bad
22:23 <@khuxkm> use printf
22:23 < jayden> no
22:23 <@khuxkm> yes
22:23 < jayden> The development of my game isn't gunna start for a longgggg while
22:23 < jayden> idk how to put in user imput soooooo its gunna have no user imput in alpha
22:23 < tomasino> read
22:23 <@khuxkm> use a programming language you silly twelve year old
22:24 < jayden> khuxkm: too hard
22:24 < jayden> WAIITTTT
22:24 < rndusr> what about c?
22:24 < jayden> python and python modules
22:24 < jayden> rndusr: HARD
22:24 <@khuxkm> it would be easier for me to kick you from the channel instead of arguing with you over this, yet I'm not kicking you from the channel
22:24 < rndusr> it's the most simplistic language
22:24 <@khuxkm> but yeah use python
22:24 < jayden> compiling is hard for novice users
22:24 < rndusr> make file
22:24 < jayden> I want this game to be out there for everyone
22:24 <@khuxkm> rndusr: that's the funniest thing I've ever heard, not gonna lie
22:25 < jayden> rndusr: I am sure C is hard
22:25 < jayden> for me anyway
22:25 <@khuxkm> it is, which is why I'm saying use Python
22:25 < jayden> what modules shal I use
22:25 <@khuxkm> is it worthwhile? yes
22:25 < rndusr> khuxkm: ;)
22:25 < tomasino> if you're making a game you'll find that using a more sophisticated language like python or lua will make your job easier in the long run than doing it in a shell script, and i LOVE shell scripts
22:25 < jayden> khuxkm: how the heck do you find the linux kernel version in python
22:26 <@khuxkm> why is the linux kernel version an integral part of your dialogue
22:26 < jayden> khuxkm: all the capabilities of this game im making is what bash ahs
22:26 <@khuxkm> why though
22:26 < jayden> khuxkm: its gunna be called "bash adventures"
22:26 < jayden> ahem "bash" in qutes
22:26 < jayden> quotes
22:26 < jayden> OK I ADMIT ITS A BAD NAME
22:26 < jayden> Its not even in alpha yet OK?
22:27 < jayden> OKKKK im gunna learn a bit of python b4 i start developin'
22:27 < jayden> i could use python turtle for graphics :P
22:27 <@khuxkm> ...i am going to commit child abuse
22:27 < tomasino> deep breaths khuxkm 
22:28 < rndusr> breathe in
22:28 < rndusr> and ot
22:28 < rndusr> s/ot/out
22:28 < sedbot> <rndusr> and out
22:28 < jayden> how to make download mirrors :P
22:28 <@khuxkm> this ain't google my friend
22:28 < jayden> i dont wanna use github for a single file thats a game
22:28 <@khuxkm> or ddg or whatever the cool kids use nowadays
22:29 < jayden> a game in one python file sounds managable
22:29 <@khuxkm> don't
22:29 <@khuxkm> you'll regret it
22:29 < jayden> Why?
22:30 <@khuxkm> because it's a pain to keep things in order
22:30 < jayden> start.sh will contain python3 1.py python3 2.py
22:30 < jayden> :D
22:30  * rndusr facepam
22:30 < jayden> with "&&" between the two commands
22:31 < jayden> then 1.py will have python turtle commands for graphics
22:31 <@khuxkm> ...i need more deep breaths
22:31 < jayden> 2.py will have the backend stuff
22:31 < jayden> DONE4
22:31 < jayden> DONE
22:31 < jayden> :DDDD 
22:31 < jayden> Will this work
22:31 < rndusr> no
22:31 < jayden> why not
22:32 < rndusr> in your sh script, you're executing the first python script and then the second
22:32 < jayden> whats wrong with that
22:32 < rndusr> you want to import the second one in the first python script
22:32 < rndusr> and then run the first on
22:32 < jayden> how can I do that
22:32 < rndusr> s/on/one/g
22:32 < sedbot> <rndusr> and then run the first one
22:32 < rndusr> file1.py
22:32 < tildebot> ・゜゜・。。・゜゜\_o< QUACK!
22:32 < jayden> hmm
22:32 < rndusr> ,bef
22:32 < tildebot> [Ducks] rndusr befriended a duck in 1.9 seconds! You've befriended 5 ducks in #team!
22:32 < rndusr> jayden: loop up import python
22:33 < jayden> so start.sh will contain python3 2.py && python3 1.py
22:33 < rndusr> no
22:33 < rndusr> that *will not* work
22:33 < jayden> Why NOT
22:33 < rndusr> it's going to run 2.py THEN 1.py
22:33 < rndusr> it will not run them curcurently
22:34 < jayden> run both at the same time?
22:34 < rndusr> no
22:34 < jayden> why NOT
22:34 < rndusr> it will not run both of them at the same time
22:34 < jayden> :(
22:34 < jayden> cant run a python script with a python scrpit
22:34 < rndusr> the && operator runs the first command, and then runs the second command conditionally
22:35 < jayden> maybeee i'll stick with bash
22:35 < rndusr> and python != shell
22:35 < rndusr> jayden: you should learn programming fundamentals before programming a game
22:35 < jayden> uhh "!="
22:35 < rndusr> != not equal to
22:35 < jayden> ???
22:35 < thefunkyspaw> Jayden: start small. Find a guided tutorial and work through it.
22:35 < jayden> orrr i can use bash
22:35 < jayden> :D
22:35 < thefunkyspaw> you have a mountain of stuff to learn, is going to take a long time, and that's okay
22:36 < rndusr> bash is *not* a programming language
22:36 < jayden> bash STILL can have games written in it
22:36 < rndusr> yes
22:36 < rndusr> but bash is NOT designed for games
22:36 < thefunkyspaw> https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-games-with-python-3-and-pygame-part-1--cms-30081
22:36 < jayden> for example cat /dev/urandom > file.txt is my favorite game
22:36 < jayden> thefunkyspaw: i'll start tomarrow i have a bedtime
22:37 < thefunkyspaw> good thinking 😁
22:37 < tildebot> [Demojize] <thefunkyspaw> good thinking :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
22:37 <@khuxkm> everyone just... let the twelve year old do his thing
22:37 < rndusr> I guess gaminess is in the eye of the beholder
22:37 <@khuxkm> he'll figure himself out soon enough
22:37 < jayden> viruses can be made in bash
22:37 < jayden> ;)

22:40 < jayden> you can make a WEB BROWSER written in bash
22:41 < jayden> have user imput of what website have the script use curl or wget to wget the website THENNNN

22:42 < tomasino> learn python by making games
22:42 < tomasino> one video, good to go
22:43 < jayden> How could you make a bash script that asks the user for a number and then set it as $NUMBER then echo $NUMBER
22:44 < jayden> I wonder
22:44 < rndusr> read -p "enter a number:" && echo ${REPLY}
22:44 < tomasino> you want the "read" command
22:44 < jayden> i didnt know about that
22:44 < tomasino> and if you want portability, you're gonna have to be careful about how you use it
22:44 < rndusr> oh
22:44 < jayden> fish: Variables cannot be bracketed. In fish, please use {$REPLY}.
22:44 < jayden> read -p "enter a number:" && echo ${REPLY} ^
22:45 < rndusr> oh
22:45 < rndusr> no
22:45 < tomasino> read -p isn't portable, but you can printf and then read. :)
22:45 < jayden> Darn it
22:45 < rndusr> tomasino: should we spare this poor, unblemished soul the troubles of hearing about portability hell
22:45 < jayden> it works in bash but not fish shell
22:45 < jayden> sad
22:45 < rndusr> jayden: fish is weird
22:45 < tomasino> fish isn't posix
22:46 < jayden> I like fish shell
22:46 < tomasino> your shell scripts will start with a hashbang telling the system what to use for scripting
22:46 < jayden> its my daily driver
22:46 < dgy> learn assembler and INSTALL GENTOO. case closed
22:46 < jayden> gentoo is hard
22:46 < tomasino> fish is great for interactivity, and it has its own scripting language, but don't expect bashisms to work
22:46 < jayden> read -p "enter a number:" && echo ${REPLY} | bash
22:46 < jayden> should work
22:47 < rndusr> nope
22:47 < jayden> NOPE
22:47 < jayden> ugh how to run a command with bash while in fishhhh
22:47 < rndusr> execute bash
22:47 < rndusr> $ bash
22:47 < rndusr> or printf "commands here lol" | bash
22:47 < kiedtl> or "bash -c "commands"
22:47 < jayden> in one line command
22:48 < kiedtl> what rndusr and I said
22:48 < kiedtl> oh, jayden's making a game in bash?
22:48 < rndusr> kiedtl: mhm
22:48 < kiedtl> why bash?
22:48 < tomasino> but all that being said, you're about to do something difficult that will require some significant planning and structure. You're gonna want a better language. Watch that video. Learn python, or lua, or even lisp. don't waste your time doing it in a shell because your first command was easy.
22:48 <@khuxkm> kiedtl: don't.
22:48 <@khuxkm> don't start
22:48 <@khuxkm> it's a long story
22:48 < kiedtl> sorry
22:48 < kiedtl> ik
22:48 < rndusr> read the hist lol
22:48 < jayden> judging me on the coding language I LIKE
22:48 < kiedtl> Yup
22:49 < kiedtl> I am
22:49 < kiedtl> jayden: bash isn' -- uh nvm
22:49 <@khuxkm> shell is not a programming language
22:49 < kiedtl> shh
22:49 < tomasino> trying to give you some advice to avoid wasting a lot of time
22:49 < rndusr> it's a SCRIPTING LANGUAGE
22:49 < tildebot> rndusr: OH? IS IT CAPPY HOUR AGAIN? HOW UNEXPECTED, JAN6
22:49 < jayden> if you were doing that in my channel it would be a 30 second ban
22:49 < kiedtl> >_>
22:49 < rndusr> tildebot: how 
22:49 <@khuxkm> it's reshout
22:49 < rndusr> of
22:49 < rndusr> oh
22:49 <@khuxkm> because you had a lot of caps in your message
22:49 < rndusr> THIS IS FUN
22:49 < jayden> EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
22:49 <@khuxkm> YEAH, IS IT CAPPY HOUR
22:49 < kiedtl> <tomasino> I'm just trying to help you, you poor child <jayden> if you did that in my channel I'd ban you
22:49 < jayden> THIS IS A BUNCH OF CAPS LMAO
22:49 < tildebot> jayden: BURN ADMINISTRATIONS TO THE GROUND
22:49 <@khuxkm> ?
22:50 < jayden> tildebot: YES
22:50 < jayden> YAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
22:50 < rndusr> how does one remove a file from a git repo
22:50 < tomasino> okay, tomasino advice is done. best of luck
22:50 < jayden> YEAH BURN THEM ADMINS
22:50 < rndusr> send halp
22:50 < kiedtl> SEIZE THE MEANS OF WRITING SHITTY BASH GAMeS
22:50 < tildebot> kiedtl: I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT RESHOUT

22:50 < tomasino> rnduser, from the repo in its current state, or all of the repo history?
22:50 < jayden> ya'll remember windows xp communism edition
22:51 < blitzkraft_> rndusr: just in one commit, or full history?
22:51 < dgy> tomasino: i'd be interested in the latter. in a separate channel maybe
22:51 < tomasino> it's ... not fun
22:51 < tomasino> and will result in rebasing the repo
22:51 < dgy> oh
22:51 < tomasino> if you have other people with it checked out they'll need to reclone
22:51 < jayden> sPEAKING OF
22:51 < rndusr> tomasino: lol I just went to the repo online and deleted it
22:52 < tomasino> https://github.com/jamestomasino/dotfiles-minimal/blob/master/.config/git/config#L110-L111
22:52 < blitzkraft_> But older commits can be navigated to
22:52 < rndusr> :com com should be removed
22:52 < sigsegv>  ☭ COM SHOULD BE REMOVED ☭ 
22:52 < tomasino> rndusr: that'll delete it from that point forward
22:52 < tomasino> in a new commit
22:52 < tomasino> but it's still in history
22:52 < blitzkraft_> Exactly
22:52 < rndusr> tomasino: http://tildegit.org/randomuser/sowm
22:52 < tomasino> if you're dealing with a security problem, that could be an issue
22:52 < rndusr> the prev commit
22:52 < tomasino> like accidentally committing a password
22:52 < rndusr> I missed the readme.md so it was readme and readme.md
22:53 < blitzkraft_> Usually, changing password is easier
22:53 < tomasino> ahh, okay, that's a no biggy one then
22:53 < rndusr> welp
22:53 < rndusr> I'm going to log off for the night
22:53 < tomasino> you're good with how you did it
