04:39 < login> https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/swiss-city-geneva-to-introduce-a-minimum-wage-of-over-4000-a-month.html
04:40 < kumquat> lol no
04:40 < kumquat> do you know how expensive switzerland is?
04:40 < kumquat> I actually got a lucrative job offer to go work in Switzerland a couple years ago and turned it down
04:41 < login> that is a minimum wage of $23 per hour
04:42 < login> switzerland must be expensive, but your savings will work better once you leave
04:43 < mspe> Rent Prices in Switzerland are 94.38% higher than in France
04:43 < mspe> Groceries Prices in Switzerland are 71.28% higher than in France
04:43 < kumquat> everything there is WAY more expensive
04:43 < kumquat> it doesn't work out to be good
04:44 < kumquat> it's like making $100,000 in California
04:44 < mspe> Restaurant Prices in Switzerland are 69.00% higher than in France
04:44 < kumquat> it sounds good on paper, but when you spend over half your salary on rent, doesn't sound so great anymore
04:46 < kumquat> there's a lot of pharma companies based in CH, it was novartis who offered me a job, but could only guarantee a 1 year contract. I've visited CH before, didn't really love it, and between that and uprooting our lives for a 1 year contract that could possibly not be extended, to find ourselves almost immediately in a financially precarious position, didn't seem wise or prudent
04:46 < mspe> Rent Prices in Estonia are 42.51% lower than in France
04:46 < mspe> Groceries Prices in Estonia are 43.54% lower than in France
04:46 < mspe> Restaurant Prices in Estonia are 27.25% lower than in France

04:54 < mspe> just random examples ^^
04:55 < kumquat> lolol
04:55 < kumquat> "random"
04:55 < login> how much is income in estonia less than france?
04:56 < kumquat> it depends on the sector
04:56 < kumquat> IT seems to be quite well-paid
04:56 < kumquat> so you have the same salary or better than in FRance
04:56 < kumquat> other sectors aren't as well-paying, though
04:56 < login> but not so for swiss IT?
04:57 < login> i see, so IT people in Estonia will find everything very affordable
04:57 < kumquat> don't know, just know for pharma for CH, just know that in calculating, even a good salary in CH, it's not that good comparably
04:57 < login> but it'll be just as expensive in switzerland for everybody else
04:58 < login> sounds like everybody in CH makes a lot of money
04:58 < login> for high rent to be so sustainable
04:58 < login> might be time to sleep on the ground floor of the office and shower in the gym
05:01 < aravk> someone give me an overview of estonia
05:01 < aravk> I literally know nothing about it
05:02 < aravk> except that it's cheaper to live there in france
05:02 < aravk> s/in/than/
05:02 < sedbot> <aravk> except that it's cheaper to live there than france
05:02 < kumquat> lol
05:02 < mspe> login: it's a little bit in average, but not the case for IT
05:02 < mspe> * bit lower
05:04 < mspe> aravk: jan6 could tell you better
05:04 < mspe> kumquat and I are just dreaming of going there
05:04 < mspe> (for now)
05:06 < mspe> and we're thinking of visiting Tallinn for my birthday

05:08 < mspe> the capital is less than 500,000 people
05:08 < mspe> the 2nd is a big students town
05:08 < mspe> they have electronic id

05:16 < kumquat> there's also the fact that almost everyone speaks English, and there's a  strong sort of Nordic vibe without the horrensously expensive nordic costs (a lot of people complain when they go to places like Finland and Sweden that everything is expensive af)

05:19 < login> Things being expensive == incomes being high
05:20 < login> otherwise, if you earn more and everything is cheap, then something is wrong and prices are due to increase
05:23 < aravk> mspe: sounds very cool
05:24 < aravk> the only negative I see after 20 minutes on wikipedia is that they have a large focus on oil shale drilling (or whatever it's called)

09:34 <~ben> i hope this winter is as easy as last winter
09:34 < kumquat> should go skiing before we leave france
09:34 <~ben> do it
09:34 <~ben> chamonix
09:34 < kumquat> skiing in the pyrenees is great
09:34 <~ben> i imagine so

09:34 <~ben> when i lived there
09:34 < hackintech> wat
09:34 < hackintech> not fairrrrr
09:34 < kumquat> I've skiied in both, but I really love the pyrenees, it's something I'll miss when we leave france
09:34 <~ben> it's incredible
09:35 <~ben> alpine skiing
09:35 <~ben> the hills are so short here
09:35 <~ben> takes like 8 minutes to ride the lift and you get to the bottom in like 30 seconds
09:35 <~ben> that's barely an exaggeration
09:36 < kumquat> you've got great skiing in canada too though
09:36 < kumquat> we went to bamff when I was a kid and the skiing there was really great
09:37 < hackintech> i hope we get lots of snow

09:41 <@cmccabe> do you have a snow blower, ben?
09:41 <~ben> yeah
09:41 < kumquat> wait, do you mean snow shoveling?
09:41 < kumquat> lol
09:41 <~ben> some people call it snow removal
09:41 < kumquat> I was like wtf is snow relocation, lol
09:41 <~ben> but it's not getting removed
09:41 <~ben> it's just getting relocated
09:41 <@cmccabe> i don't mind snow shoveling, except on stairs.  i hate shoveling stairs
09:41 < kumquat> fair
09:41 < hackintech> it is getting relocated, hopefully to france
09:41 < kumquat> lol
09:41 <~ben> i hate shoveling
09:42 < kumquat> hopefully to the pyrenees so I can ski :P
09:42 < kumquat> I don't want snow in Bordeaux

09:42 < kumquat> people don't know how to drive when there's rain, and we get rain all the time
09:42 < hackintech> nice, we like accidents

11:02 -!- cren [cren@tilde.team] has joined #team
11:04 < jtmlis> okay trying my hardest to find a central repo of all the schools in my province, there has to be a master file that feeds all the other client interfaces. I just cant find it
11:04 < jtmlis> anton: and you?
11:04 < cren> good hello friends
11:04 < anton> I'm doing okay

11:07 < jtmlis> How did you figure that out?

11:07 < jtmlis> ohhh, thank you so much kirch!!!
11:08 < kirch> SO - the map doesn't let you right-click anywhere - but if you open a point on the map there's a link you can click on, and that will give you a place to do "inspect elemement" - from there I found it was an iframe, so I copied teh src url into a new window, then started looking at the code there...
11:08 < kirch> datURL:

11:09 < kirch> so, they're base64 encoding a bunch of stuff and cramming it in the URL
11:10 < jtmlis> okay wow thank you. You really helped me out it is a for a good cause. I am scraping the data to create a google custom search engine to search schools exclusively
11:10  * cren thinks that is probably bad design
11:10 < kirch> and here's the decoded base64 on the 211 search: https://i.imgur.com/ozLjgwc.png

11:12 < kirch> SO... you can create your own searches for that site as a JSON object like that - then do btoa(JSON.stringify(searchjson)) - to get a 211ontario.ca search.... not sure if other provinces are recorded on that site or not though
11:17 < jtmlis> kirch I am  still trying to find how you go to the 211 link from the map, I am using the developer console, to search. If you have time later, can you show me? As for json a little past my skill level, I was planning on using python, beautifulsoup and selenium to scrape data to a csv. really beginner stuff
11:18 < jtmlis> kirch never mind I got it, under mapframe--> js --> https://www.ontario.ca/js/featsMap.js?v=2
11:19 < jtmlis> I am going to try and get access to the api, but no for canada, the most comprehensive directory I found is https://www.cicic.ca/869/resultats.canada?search=

11:21 < kirch> jtmlis: yup
11:23 < kirch> jtmlis: another way you can do this is with DevTools - in Chrome you right-click and inspect an element and it pops up that window? well, hit the network tab then refresh the page - that will show everything the page loads, and you can sort by XHR (stuff loaded with AJAX) or just Javascript files... that's a good way to find everything

11:45 < aravk> hey
11:45 < jtmlis> putting it in the idea bin.

11:45 < kumquat> yes kumquat
11:45 < aravk> I'm mainly on tilde so I would say tilde, but put it wherever
11:45 < jan6> hackintech's entire schtick is to say "no jan6" to everything
11:46 < aravk> it's a pretty good schtick
11:46 < jan6> also available "bad jan6" "no" and "not jan6!"
11:46 < kumquat> kumquat's whole schtick is being kumquat
11:46 < aravk> jan6: tell me about estonia
11:46 < aravk> it seems very interesting
11:46 < aravk> would like to know more

11:49 < jan6> so sad j-zone ain't coming as soon...
11:49 < kumquat> hmm ducks aren't as good at conducting heat like cats
11:49 < aravk> how expensive is it to live there?
11:49  * aravk doesn't have any cats

11:49 < kumquat> but my cats stubbornly refuse to sleep on my feet, instead preferring my lap or boobs
11:49 < aravk> oof
11:49  * jan6 has no idea about expensiveness
11:49 < jan6> but nowhere near as bad as actual metropolises and stuff, lol
11:50 < aravk> pretty cool
11:50 < jan6> if you go a little away from cities/towns you should be able to get pretty cheap
11:50 < jan6> just means a little commute
11:50  * kumquat wants to live in the forest
11:50 < aravk> there have to be pictures of people covered from head to toe in different cute animals, right?
11:50 < jan6> but that's just normal logic
11:50 < jan6> good for you kumquat, you can, lol
11:51 < aravk> I'm taking an economics class in high school and from the looks of it the entire thing is broken from day 1
11:51 < jan6> lol how so?

11:52 < tildebot> „Éª„Çú„Çú„Éª„ÄÇ„ÄÇ„Éª„Çú„Çú\_o< QUACK!

11:52 < jan6> lol
11:52 < cren> just opened the terminal window
11:52 < jan6> all hail jan6 btw
11:52 < aravk> welp
11:52 < kirch> That's Orthodox Economics for ya - all the stuff that recognized "humans are not rational actors" is called "Heterodox Economics"
11:52 < jan6> humans are semi-rational actors
11:52 < aravk> I should look into that
11:52 < aravk> thanks kirch
11:53 < aravk> but the issue I think is a bit deeper than that
11:53 < aravk> money seems to increase exponentially
11:53 < aravk> so if someone starts off with say $200 compared to someone who starts of with $100
11:53 < kirch> I just read this thing, and rage-quit like 3 paragraphs in... https://www.fnbsf.com/why-are-interest-rates-so-low/
11:53 < tildebot> [Title] Why Are Interest Rates So Low? - The First National Bank in Sioux Falls
11:53 < aravk> the first person will over time be able to grow their money much faster than the second person
11:54 < aravk> so basically all the people who gained money first will always have the upper hand over all the others
11:55 < kirch> people who print/distribute the currency have no incentive to not take a cut off the top
11:55 < aravk> there's also this whole concept of unequal information
11:57 < jan6> lol of course
11:57 < aravk> the issue is that the current system is the 'easy' way
11:58 < aravk> i.e. simplest
11:58 < aravk> at least at the core
11:58 < aravk> so trying to stick the concept of equality/equity in there is difficult
11:58 < jan6> the problem with "first to money" is that if you start with more, unless the other party innovates noticeably to get past you, you can always just match whatever they're doing, better and more
11:58 < jan6> but that's nothing hard to figure out
11:59 < jan6> problem is that it's near impossible to top the high ups after a while
11:59 < kirch> Well, the current system is "The Way It's Always Been" - the people who were wealthy fuedal lords have descendants who are now wealthy businessmen

11:59 < aravk> ^
12:00 < aravk> you could always go back and think about what the point of money is
12:00 < kirch> David Graeber's Debt: the first 5000 years is a really good book
12:01 < aravk> money is from one point of view a translation system telling you how valued things are relative to each other
12:03 < aravk> from another point of view it's a promise from the government that they owe you a certain value of stuff (e.g. gold)
12:03 < aravk> but whatever
12:03 < aravk> not in the mood to do thinking
12:04 < jan6> lets just go back to natural trading, plz
12:04 < jan6> let everyone say how much THEY think something is worth

12:40 < aravk> jan6: I don't think there is a difference
12:40 < aravk> thanks kumquat
12:40 < blitzkraft> usually, computer screens have a higher dpi.
12:40  * aravk eats the kumquats
12:40 < kumquat> well in our case it's to avoid paying a TV tax, lol
12:40 < blitzkraft> wait, wat?
12:40 < blitzkraft> wtf is a tv tax?
12:40 < kumquat> in France you pay 100+ euros because you own a TV
12:40 < blitzkraft> and why tf is that a thing?
12:40 < jtmlis> holy moly really !!
12:40 < mspe> you pay every year to finance the bullshit you get on public tv
12:41 < kumquat> every year on your income taxes
12:41 < mspe> (if you own a tv)
12:41 < jan6> so, if you use computer monitors to hook up to a TV, is that tv or no?
12:41 < jan6> lol
12:41 < hackintech> why do you need a tv license
12:41 < kumquat> but French tv is TERRRIBLE to begin with
12:41 < kumquat> so fuck that
12:41 < blitzkraft> didn't anyone think it is irrelevant at the present day?
12:41 < jan6> probably still better than chinese/japanese tv
12:41 < mspe> (if you own smething with a tuner: tv, vcr, internet box, etc.)
12:41 < jan6> ,yt japan tv is

12:41 < jan6> hmm
12:41 < jtmlis> considering the state of public television what a waste. I miss the educational content they had on before. Now at least the CBC is like government fox or something with 2 and half men or something
12:41 < jan6> not that video
12:42 < hackintech> hmm
12:42 < mspe> it's something like 140‚Ç¨/year
12:42 < jan6> but like, ALLL the shows are the same, a formula that old people like, different topics, different hosts, pretty much same content
12:43 < hackintech> do people come to your house and verify it
12:43 < jtmlis> I wish they gave that money to youtubers, would be interesting just imagine
12:43 < hackintech> and if you don't have one then what are you arrested or what
12:43 < kumquat> hackintech: yes
12:44 < jtmlis> not the popular youtubers either, really fringe ones
12:44 < hackintech> go to jail for not having tv license
12:44 < kumquat> and they don't arrest you, but you pay a fine and you'll have to pay the tax from now on
12:44 < mspe> plus extra big fine
12:44 < mspe> they already sent a letter to me
12:44 < mspe> asking to testify that we didn't own a tv
12:45 < hackintech> jail, go to jail
12:45 < jtmlis> LOL
12:45 < mspe> they didn't come to check but I responded that yes they could come verify if they want
12:46 < blitzkraft> what is the legal language for defining a tv and not a computer screen? just the tuner/vcr stuff?
12:46 < kumquat> I'll sic a cat on them if they do

12:46 < mspe> the tuner, yes
12:46 < blitzkraft> so, if you're watching tv through internet, that wouldn't be taxed?
12:46 < mspe> usb tuner, vcr, tv, pci tuner, internet box
12:46 < blitzkraft> oh, internet box - so the modem/router from ISP?
12:46 < mspe> no, physical tuner, but we don't even watch tv through internet streaming
12:47 < mspe> yeah because the ‚Äúboxes‚Äù in france mix router, phone and tv tuner
12:47 < mspe> but we have no box, we use 4G usb modems
12:47 < mspe> internet only
12:47 < blitzkraft> I see. it just seems like an arbitrary distinction, in the present day. it was perhaps logical about 20 years ago
12:48 < mspe> they keep debating about it but didn't change it
12:48 < mspe> I'm fine with it cause we never watch tv anyway
12:48 < mspe> even through the internet, cause there's even more ads than if you did watch tnt tv
12:48 < mspe> (and the programs are horrible)
12:49  * Dr-WaSabi hasn't watched tv in over a year
12:49 < mspe> trash tv, tons of ads, stupid games, false debates, stupid shit, reruns
12:49 < blitzkraft> yup
12:49 < mspe> I stopped watching tv in 2009

15:01 < blitzkraft> hacktoberfest hack: you can do PRs on your own repos
15:01 < blitzkraft> and they count towards that.
15:01 < tomasino> really?
15:02 < tomasino> that's kinda silly
15:02 < tomasino> if you want a super easy hacktoberfest PR place, you can add color schemes to my Stutter plugin
15:02 < tomasino> https://github.com/jamestomasino/stutter/wiki/Themes
15:03 < blitzkraft> there is some drama around it. project maintainers getting flooded with documentation PRs, typos and adding a comma and such.
15:03 < blitzkraft> and some particular users abusing it, and intentionally making multiple PRs for each edit.
15:06 < aewens> Starting last year, they also are reviewing PRs to see if they are in the "spirit" of the dev holiday, so no more "Add your name to a registry" repos for free PRs.
15:07 < blitzkraft> ah. neat. I tried getting a few PRs in last year. they didn't get merged in time.

15:22 < hackintech> oh man
15:22 < kumquat> my mom complained my sister's kids aren't as smart as she feels they should be
15:22 < kumquat> like.... wtaf
15:22 < hackintech> gosh darn
15:23 < kumquat> and she thinks it's because my sister works full-time and she isn't dedicating enough of her personal time to making them smarter
15:24 < kumquat> "you were reading and knew your multiplication tables by the time you were 4"
15:24 < kumquat> so obviously if her kids aren't doing the same they're dummies
15:24 < kumquat> lol
15:26 < tomasino> hah
15:26 < tomasino> your mom is a trip
15:27 < blitzkraft> isn't it way to early to determine if a kid is "smart"? I mean, they need nurturing, not criticism, at that age.

15:27 < kumquat> she also ranted about one of my cousins giving himself airs about claiming he has a PhD when she's convinced he doesn't "because he only did 4 years of school after high school"
15:28 < kirch> I always figure it's "Tiger Mom" sorta stuff
15:28 < kumquat> and then spent 10 minutes explaining my sister's higher education and my other cousin's

15:38 < kumquat> she doesn't need parenting lessons
15:38 < kirch> my mom's kids are all potheads :3
15:38 < kumquat> she needs lessons in not being so judgmental and harsh on people she supposedly loves
15:39 < kumquat> on the one hand calling me her most brilliant child while also not-so subtly making it known once again that it's a disappointment I don't have a PhD
15:40 < tomasino> the firefox webextension node module has vulnerablilities in its chain of dependencies which they need to fix upstream. my repo keeps yelling at me about it. They also broke the ability to preview in firefox locally with the most recent version. Mozilla is a mess
15:40 < kumquat> she's obsessed with status and education and what she considers intelligence
15:40 < tomasino> i'd report these issues to them, but they closed their IRC server and moved to matrix
15:41 < tomasino> tell her you got a PhD two years ago but just didn't tell her because she cares too much about it
15:41 < kumquat> lmao
15:41 < kumquat> that is actually.... not a bad idea
15:41 < tomasino> if she asks you from where, just say, "see? you care about it too much"
