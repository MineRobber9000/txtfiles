23:27 <~khuxkm> oh boy are we talking about girls and guys being weird about girls?
23:27 < sillyfanboy> lol
23:27 < sillyfanboy> yeah
23:27 <~khuxkm> I've got one hell of a story if that's the convo topic
23:27 < sillyfanboy> it tat convo
23:27 < sillyfanboy> that*
23:28 < brendo> no it isn't afaict but SPILL THE TEA
23:28 <~khuxkm> so there's this girl, we'll call her Cici
23:28 <~khuxkm> she was dating a dude named Eric
23:28 <~khuxkm> (again, not real names, just anonymizing)
23:28 < june> ok actually someone did have a crush on me in school but we only really talked online, and then I finished school, and then we started hanging out in person
23:28 <~khuxkm> they seem to be doing well, but eventually Eric and Cici break up
23:28 <~khuxkm> Cici starts dating Trenton, one of my friends
23:29 <~khuxkm> again, they seem to be doing well
23:29 <~khuxkm> but Eric's being a little bit of a stalker (Eric has some mental health issues, used to be a special ed student my mom worked with)
23:29 < brendo> uh ohhhh
23:30 <~khuxkm> well, eventually, Trenton just tells Eric to knock it off, and Eric, not wanting a confrontation (probably knowing at least a few guys on the football team would totally back Trenton on this), leaves Cici alone
23:30 < june> by the way dating someone 4 years younger than you in high school is a weird time I don't think I'd recommend it
23:30 <~khuxkm> so all is well, right?
23:30 <~khuxkm> W R O N G
23:30 < brendo> was just about to say
23:30 <~khuxkm> gimme a sec I gotta pull up something real quick
23:31 < brendo> something tells me this eric guy went full psycho
23:31 <~khuxkm> nope
23:32 <~khuxkm> nvm I found it
23:33 <~khuxkm> so Cici invites Trenton over for her birthday party, right?
23:33 < brendo> riiiight
23:34 <~khuxkm> and the party goes well, except this other dude (who we'll call Jake, not only for anonymizing reasons, but because he's a bit of a snake) hogs her attention all night
23:34 <~khuxkm> Cici tells Evan she doesn't like Jake like that, and all seems to be fine
23:34 <~khuxkm> but again, if you thought everything was going to be fine, you'd be W R O N G
23:34 < brendo> he's already starting to sound more like a dog rather than a snake
23:34 < sillyfanboy> so she was really after you?
23:35 < sillyfanboy> in some weird way
23:35 <~khuxkm> nope
23:35 <~khuxkm> I'm not involved in this story
23:35 <~khuxkm> well, apart from being someone ancillary to it
23:35 < sillyfanboy> btw don't forget hw
23:35 <~khuxkm> already finito
23:36 <~khuxkm> so Jake's 100% head-over-heels for Cici, if that wasn't obvious
23:36 <~khuxkm> he should know she's dating Trenton, and Trenton even thinks he does, but he's still trying to get with her
23:36 <~khuxkm> to the point where he tried to do... the nasty with her after her birthday party
23:36  * june pleasantly thinking about jake the snake roberts
23:37 <~khuxkm> (W H O   T H E   F U C K   D O E S   T H A T ?)
23:37 < brendo> the nasty as in the nasty that causes kids if you dont wear protecc?
23:37 <~khuxkm> yep
23:37 <~khuxkm> so trenton's pissed
23:37 <~khuxkm> (duh)
23:37 < brendo> yeahhhh jake's def a dog to me now
23:37 < june> this is the slowest storytelling of quite a straightforward series of events
23:38 <~khuxkm> but he's not going to beat the shit outta Jake because he knows Cici can hold his own
23:38 <~khuxkm> june: well to be fair I don't remember the particulars so I'm reading chat logs and trying to convey the story here
23:38 <~khuxkm> so spirit week rolls around, and Cici's acting a little distant
23:38 < brendo> on a totally unrelated note https://ttm.sh/QBq.png
23:38 <~khuxkm> especially compared to how she was acting around Trenton before
23:39 <~khuxkm> Trenton figures it's just about the whole issue with Jake
23:39 < brendo> oop metalwork time back in about an hour and 10
23:39 <~khuxkm> so the day before the dance, Cici tells Trenton she just wants to go with him as a friend
23:39 <~khuxkm> (doesn't want to make others jealous)
23:40 <~khuxkm> Trenton agrees
23:40 < sillyfanboy> trenton is a name of a area in my city
23:40 < sillyfanboy> sorry had to say that lol
23:40 <~khuxkm> well it's the name the real-life Trenton picked for himself
23:40 <~khuxkm> so nyeh
23:41 <~khuxkm> anyways, the dance rolls around, and Cici seems to be more hanging around Jake than Trenton
23:41 < sillyfanboy> oh boy
23:41 <~khuxkm> so Trenton's like "whatever, I'll just try and get my turn to dance with her later on"
23:41  * june thinking about dating jake the snake roberts
23:41 < sillyfanboy> i can imagine that cici is the type who into open relationships
23:41 <~khuxkm> idk about that
23:41 < BitBot> ・゜゜・。。・゜゜\_o< QUACK!
23:41 < june> ,bef
23:41 < BitBot> [Ducks] june befriended a duck in 1.65 seconds! You've befriended 355 ducks in #meta!
23:42 <~khuxkm> welp, about half the dance goes on and he decides he wants his turn with his girlfriend (did I mention Cici and Trenton are dating at this point?)
23:42 < june> I've never been to a dance
23:42 <~khuxkm> and she says no, that she doesn't want to make Jake jealous
23:42 < death> khuxkm: yes you did mention it
23:42 <~khuxkm> so Trenton's like "fuck this I'm out"
23:43 <~khuxkm> death: I'm reinforcing that because of what happens next
23:43 <~khuxkm> so Trenton goes back over to everyone else to say goodbye, and Cici just up and fucking kisses Jake right in front of him
23:43 < june> oh my. such drama. big scandal.
23:43 <~khuxkm> he leaves and posts about it on social media (obviously not happy about it)
23:43 < sillyfanboy> well when highschool or school in general is your life
23:44 < sillyfanboy> it kind of is at the moment june
23:44 < june> trenton should have chosen a name like andre, so I can imagine this as wrestling fanfic
23:44 <~khuxkm> and she messages him something to the effect of "oh I was going to say sorry but now I won't because you made a stink about it"
23:44 <~khuxkm> june: but Trenton and Jake aren't the ones dating :P
23:44 < june> khuxkm: andre and jake were long time rivals
23:44 <~khuxkm> anyways, she gets Trenton to apologize and they spend the rest of the month arguing about it
23:44 <~khuxkm> oh
23:45 <~khuxkm> so I'd probably also want to change Cici's name if that were the case :P
23:45 < wgreenhouse> !toot trenton should have chosen a name like andre, so I can imagine this as wrestling fanfic
23:45 < tooter> tooted! https://tilde.zone/@tildeverse/104328954772898931
23:46 < sillyfanboy> the wrestling anime
23:46 < sillyfanboy> best wrestling anime of 2020
23:46 <~khuxkm> anyways, Cici up and leaves Trenton for Jake, so Trenton takes his lunch group (which was him, me, and another friend) with him to another table (since he was sick and tired of seeing them being together)
23:46 <~khuxkm> and then Cici and Jake move to a table near where Trenton moved to
23:46 < june> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Jake_Roberts_and_Andre.jpg
23:47 <~khuxkm> later, Jake just up and asks Trenton where to take Cici on a date
23:47 < sillyfanboy> i think when i get a wig for female. i want to get a cool colour for the wig but not sure
23:47 <~khuxkm> Trenton doesn't think anything of it at the time and gives a normal response ("there's really only fast-food restaurants around here")
23:47 <~khuxkm> but later on he decides that's a fucked up thing to ask the guy who's girlfriend you stole
23:48 <~khuxkm> so he confronts Jake about it the next day and Jake's all like "do you wanna start shit?"
23:48 < june> > This began a heated feud throughout the summer of 1988, which escalated after Rude began wearing a pair of tights emblazoned with a visage of Mrs. Roberts, which an irate Roberts tore off.
23:48 < june> god I love just reading random bits about wrestling storylines
23:48 < sillyfanboy> 60 days in the khuxkm story
23:49 <~khuxkm> and Trenton's like "Dude. No. I just don't appreciate you rubbing the fact that you and Cici are together in my face."
23:49 <~gbmor> o.o
23:49 <~khuxkm> and the whole time Jake's like "fuck off, get the fuck away from me, asshole, I'll fuck you up"
23:49 <~gbmor> i hope trenton can scrap
23:49  * gbmor popcorn
23:50 < june> hey #meta remember the time khuxkm started telling a story about high school relationships
23:50 <~khuxkm> I mean, you're a bit late with the popcorn
23:50 < sillyfanboy> this is better then any anime i have watched in the past month
23:50 <~khuxkm> nothing really came of it
23:50 < june> I rememeber it like it was yesterday
23:50 <~khuxkm> jake's too much of a wuss to actually do anything
23:50 <~khuxkm> june: that's because it was yesterday :V
23:50 <~gbmor> i just exited a game and saw this happening and read it
23:50 < death> isn't drama fun.
23:50 < sillyfanboy> we almost need like a story bot gbmor 
23:50 < sillyfanboy> of all the stories told
